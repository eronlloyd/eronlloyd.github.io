# Anti-Corruption Policy Toolkit

The right policy tools can be just as powerful as software on impacting change, so I've been researching
and collecting all the resources I can find on the subject. From businesses to public institutions,
there are an impressive array of best practices, templates, and even international standard to both
prevent or address bribery and fraud risks. I hope to use what I've learned to not only raise awareness
through content but provide a clearinghouse of information for individuals and organizations.
