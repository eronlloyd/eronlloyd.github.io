-   ## :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } Democrobot AI

    ---

    Democrobot AI is a suite of open source, purpose-built software designed for supporting grassroot
    efforts to pass pro-democracy, anti-corruption legislation everywhere, for everyone. I believe that
    by harnessing the power of AI on public data we can develop advanced tools for impactful reform.

-   ## :octicons-stop-16:{ .lg .middle } Anti-Corruption Policy Toolkit

    ---

    When it comes to stopping corruption, prevention is the best policy. During my years of researching
    the issue, I've collected many resources including best practices, policy templates, and even
    international standards. My goal is to create a toolkit to stop bribery and fraud where it
    starts.
