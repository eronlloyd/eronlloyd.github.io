# About

Welcome to my personal website. In an era where we tend to scatter our presence online,
I thought it would be useful to take back some of that control and consolidate important content
here instead. From personal writing to projects and initiatives I'm involved in, and even my
attempts to become an artist, I plan to share all that with you.

Professionally, I'm currently an information and communication technology (ICT) designer, primarily
focused on large scale telecom and data center projects across the U.S. For the past few years I've
enjoyed growing and learning in the industry and sharing those experiences, and I intend to continue
that here.

In a previous life I worked as an economist and data/policy analyst, where I realized my passion for
data and analysis as an integral part of problem solving. I enjoyed working on many policy topics,
including economic development, anti-poverty strategies, land reform, monetary theory, commons
policies, choice theory, and basic income. I still care about these topics and may explore them
further as well.

Outside of work, I've also been concentrating on several efforts I'm extremely passionate about,
particularly campaigning for pro-democracy and anti-corruption legislative reform with organizations
like [March on Harrisburg](https://www.mohpa.org), [Represent US](https://represent.us/), and
[Equal Citizens](https://equalcitizens.us/). I've seen firsthand how [corruption can ruin our
World](blog/posts/how_corruption_ruins_the_world.md), and I'm committed to helping to fight back. Expect
a lot of discussion on this urgent topic, and I hope to recruit you to the cause.

To help stay strong in body, mind, and spirit, I've sought refuge in the Dharma in 2015, and have
been a Zen Buddhist practicioner ever since. As part of that practice, I intend to produce and share
personal writings and art that draw from that storehouse of wisdom, seeking to promote peace within
myself and in a World that could always use more.

I'm happy if you find any of this useful and enjoyable. :folded_hands:
