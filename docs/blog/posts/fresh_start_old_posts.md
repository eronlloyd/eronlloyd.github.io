# A Fresh Start with Some Old Posts

It's time to start writing again. Not just quick updates on LinkedIn, but the more detailed and
involving pieces that I love to produce. A good old-fashioned blog, in fact.

Over the years I've scattered work around other platforms like Medium and LinkedIn, and while
generally they provide the tools needed to easily share content, I wanted more control over
creating, organizing, and preserving my content. Having a personal website is the ideal way
to do that.

From the look of the pages to the URL used to link back too, it empowers more creativity in
the creation and curation of your work, without having the platform make decisions in ways
that could change or break your intented presentation, which they often do. So while I have many
new ideas for things to write, I'm going to first re-publish some existing pieces here first,
updating and revising them where possible.

For anyone curious about the technical details of the site, I'm using the fantastic [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) static page generator, hosted for free on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com). I currently use it for all my documentation and project websites,
and give thanks to the open source community that supports it.
