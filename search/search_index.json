So it\u2019s no surprise when I say I love data centers\u2014those amazing buildings that store most of the World\u2019s data and make it available to us all as the Internet and the \u201cCloud.\u201d The Internet itself is technically a massive network connecting data centers, and the Cloud is technically someone else\u2019s computers, which are typically stored\u2014no surprise again\u2014in data centers.</p> <p>In this certification review, I\u2019m going to cover the BICSI Data Center Design Design Consultant (DCDC) certification. It\u2019s been 18 months since my BICSI OSP certification, and it felt especially good to now complete the DCDC.</p> <p>Early in my career I got pulled into the unfamiliar world of OSP and had to crash course it, so getting the OSP designation gave me confidence in and validation of new topics I needed to learn. But in getting the DCDC, it felt like coming home to some of the things I know and do best: managing racks of servers and the network equipment that connect them, along with the critical systems and building envelope that keep everything working.</p> <p>One of my first responsibilities in my ICT career was being the project manager for two telecommunication huts that would deliver FTTX services across a small city. Each one was fed with diverse network and power sources, housed cable plant and equipment within five racks, and required HVAC equipment to clean and cool the space. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but I was building data centers.</p> <p>I found the project both fascinating and stressful. I was still trying to understand the fundamentals of everything involved, so it was helpful to observe everything literally being constructed and connected. The many move/add/change issues created challenges and even conflicts, and as PM I had to mediate and resolve them without truly understanding.</p> <p>Just as with OSP, learning how to design and operate data centers was a complicated process, and had to be delayed while I focusing on learning many other aspects of the job. Having already gotten involved in BICSI and completed the OSP Designer in 2021, I decided to pursue the DCDC credential, and will share my experience with you.</p> <p>For full disclosure, while I am a dues-paying BICSI member and certification holder, this review is completely independent and not affiliated with or sponsored by BICSI in any way. All opinions are my own and are intended to inform readers about this certification and provide honest feedback about my experience in obtaining it.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-dcdc-certification-review/#what-is-the-bicsi-data-center-design-consultant-certification","title":"What is the BICSI Data Center Design Consultant Certification?","text":"<p>According to BICSI, a certified Data Center Design Consultant</p> <p>[d]esigns, coordinates or manages the integration of the documentation, plans, specifications, construction and ongoing operational management activities of a data center facility while meeting applicable codes, standards and industry best practices. This includes addressing the requirements of the sponsor, architects, engineers, contractors, stakeholders, service providers and others involved. </p> <p>The credential, then, is for ICT designers certified to design and build data centers to the BICSI data center standard. Candidates for the credential will need to practice and demonstrate their abilities in the following areas as part of the exam:</p> <ul> <li>Concept Planning &amp; Analysis</li> <li>Systems</li> <li>Information Technology / Ancillary Systems / Communications Connectivity</li> <li>Data Center Operations &amp; Maintenance Assessment</li> <li>Security Assessment</li> <li>Construction Administration &amp; Commissioning</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-dcdc-certification-review/#where-can-i-find-related-resources","title":"Where Can I Find Related Resources?","text":"<p>As always, the first resource you should get\u2014and review carefully\u2014is the certification guide/exam objectives document, which covers the prerequisites, training/exam materials, exam fees/rules, and other critical information. BICSI calls them certification handbooks, and you can get the DCDC Certification Handbook for free on BICSI\u2019s website.</p> <p>There are two primary study material resources for this certification. The first is the  ANSI/BICSI 002-2019, Data Center Design and Implementation Best Practices. BICSI-002, as it\u2019s called for short, is the main standard you will be designing data centers around. At 551 pages, it\u2019s longer than most standards, but is comprehensive in its depth. For more details, I will soon cover BICSI 002 in a separate review.</p> <p>The second resource is BICSI\u2019s Essentials of Data Center Projects (EDCP), First Edition. This 250 page guide covers all data center project planning, implementation, management, and documentation processes.  For more details, I will soon cover Essentials of Data Center Projects in a separate review.</p> <p>For my personal preparation, I purchased a DCDC Test Prep bundle of the above two resources and the DCDC Test Prep Course. Completing this course, which is a self-paced training that includes interactive modules, hundreds of flash cards, and a practice test, along with reading the above publications, and some positive energy and support from friends on LinkedIn are what I used to pass the test. I\u2019ll talk more about training options and study tips further below.</p> <p>Note that there is also another related publication, BICSI 009-2019, Data Center Operations and Maintenance Best Practices, that provides valuable operational guidance but is not considered primary study material. If you\u2019re serious about learning and applying your data center stills, I recommend getting it, but it is not necessary for passing the exam and you shouldn\u2019t focus on it while studying. Like the other resources, I will be publishing a review of that in the coming months.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-dcdc-certification-review/#should-i-pursue-this-certification","title":"Should I Pursue this Certification?","text":"<p>Unlike in OSP engineering, there are actually a surprising number of certifications for data centers roles, so you have some choices here. In addition to BICSI\u2019s DCDC, there is C-Net\u2019s Certified Data Centre Design Professional (CDCDP), which has just been acquired by the Uptime Institute. The Uptime Institute, too, has several data center certifications, such as the Accredited Tier Designer (ATD). Also noteworthy is Data Center Dynamics\u2019 Data Center Specialist (DCS) certification, which covers power and cooling.</p> <p>Despite these other options, however, if your role is to design, build, or operate data centers of any size or scale, I recommend you acquire the BICSI DCDC certification. Granted, I have not taken the other programs, and am sure there is definitely value there that could compliment the DCDC. But from my perspective, the DCDC provided me the best value as someone established in the ICT industry and also heavily steeped in BICSI methodologies. I think that last consideration is particularly key.</p> <p>If you are an ICT professional that applies BICSI training and methodologies, then becoming a DCDC is the best direction to go. Note, however, that the DCDC program will NOT cover the fundamentals provided as part of the RCDD program, so I recommend having your RCDD credential before pursuing the DCDC credential\u2014think of the DCDC (and OSP) credential as an advanced certification that builds on what you learn while earning the RCDD designation.</p> <p>That said, I was not an RCDD when I became a DCDC; it is definitely possible to do it this way. In fact, you can become a DCDC without any BICSI credentials at all. According to the DCDC Certification Handbook, you\u2019ll qualify through one of the following eligibility options:</p> <ol> <li>Hold a current Registered Communications Distribution Designer (RCDD) certification.</li> <li>Have two (2) years of verifiable full-time equivalent work experience in data center design, construction and/or operations and hold a current BICSI Technician, Registered Telecommunications Project Manager (RTPM), or Outside Plant (OSP) certification. In place of holding a certification, a degree in architecture, engineering or construction management is also acceptable.</li> <li>Three (3) years of verifiable full-time equivalent work experience in data center design, construction and/or operations within the past seven (7) years.</li> </ol> <p>I qualified for Option #2; I had over four years of DC experience at that point, plus I was a BICSI OSP Designer, too. Option #3 is more than enough for someone with several years of DC experience, however, and I\u2019m glad that\u2019s an option, too. The DC industry is anticipating a large shortage of talent as the first generation of DC personnel begin aging out while demand for DCs is ramping up.</p> <p>If you currently meet the qualifications and are considering becoming a DCDC, there really hasn\u2019t been a better time than now to do it. If you are new to the DC industry, however, and are looking to become a DCDC as a way to break into the field, you\u2019ll need to do a bit more before you can obtain this prestigious title. My recommendation in this case is to do the following:</p> <ul> <li>Read Jumpstart Your Career in Data Centers by Carrie Goetz to get a fantastic introduction to the industry and all the opportunities before you. Hands down, that should be step one.</li> <li>Immerse yourself in the DC community, and get involved with groups such as the Infrastructure Masons to find field guides and mentors to help you on your journey.</li> <li>Complete your RCDD first to establish a solid foundation as an ICT designer. If you have two years of ICT work experience and two years of higher education, or at least five years of ICT work experience, regardless of educational background, you qualify.</li> <li>Begin your DCDC training process as I\u2019ll describe below. Remember that you can begin your training well before you meet the work experience requirements in any case, so the sooner you get started, the better.</li> </ul> <p>I know it\u2019s a lot, but trust me, it\u2019s worth the effort. As someone that came into ICT in reverse, these are the exact steps I would have followed myself had I found the right resources and guidance at the beginning.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-dcdc-certification-review/#how-can-i-pass-this-certification","title":"How Can I Pass this Certification?","text":"<p>So whether you qualify to take the exam now or need time to prepare, you still need a solid plan to pass. Return to the DCDC Certification Handbook, and review the exam blueprint. If you\u2019ve focused your study efforts on the learning resources listed above, evaluate how comfortable you feel answering potential questions about any of the topics.</p> <p>The blueprints actually list what percentage of the exam will involve each topic, with a breakdown of the included areas of expertise. Use this as a framework for tracking your comfort level on each topic, and focus your energy on the areas you\u2019re not yet strong in. Below I\u2019ll share some related techniques that have worked for me while passing twelve ICT certifications at this point, all on the first try.</p> <p>I've had a number of people ask me which chapters to focus on, especially those who already took the RCDD. Unlike the TDMM, there are no \"core chapters\" so the simple answer is \"EVERYTHING.\" But there is strategy in everything, so here's a pro-tip to help: gauge your focus by using the percentages in the blueprint.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, the Concept Planning &amp; Analysis area of expertise is 25% of the exam, and reviewing the topics listed under it, you'll see nearly all of them are covered in EDCP, Ch. 2, EDCP, 002-2019, Ch. 5: Site Selection, and 002-2019, Ch 6: Space Planning. In contrast, the Construction Administration &amp; Commissioning area of expertise is 10% of the exam, and is covered by EDCP, Ch. 2, EDCP, Ch. 3, and 002-2019, Ch. 16: Commissioning.</p> <p>You can see EDCP, Ch. 2 popping up twice, so that seems to be important, and 002-2016, Ch. 5 covers a lot of topics, so that's probably important, too. Do this exercise for the entire blueprint, start checking off the topics and chapters you become comfortable with, and process the rest  from there. Reinforce that with flash cards, and you've got a great feedback loop!</p> <p>I will say, from my experience, A LOT of questions came from the EDCP, so make sure you know that front to back. As for the BICSI 002, I felt like questions came from a diverse set of the chapters, so it was harder to assess which was more.\u00a0Of course, the safest thing to do is cover it all well, as each exam is different, but apply my process above to be more efficient and effective in your efforts.</p> <p>If you need a more structured guide to training and studying than simply reading the BICSI-002 and EDCP, the handbook lists a \u201csuggested study\u201d plan to coordinate with your review and coverage of the blueprint:</p> <ul> <li>125-plus hours of independent study from the above reference materials</li> <li>DC101: Introduction to Data Center Design</li> <li>DC102: Applied Data Center Design and Best Practices</li> <li>DCDC Online Test Preparation Course</li> </ul> <p>No matter your study plan, ensure you invest in the \u201c125 hours of independent study,\u201d as this is the minimum you should plan for to be successful. Make sure you\u2019ve read the learning resources carefully, as exam questions can come from anywhere within it!</p> <p>If you are new to DCs and just reading the learning resources isn\u2019t increasing your comprehension of the material, taking both DC101 and DC102 could be helpful. BICSI has some awesome instructors, and I took this route for my OSP and benefited significantly from Mark and Tom\u2019s insights, as well as hearing the experiences of the other students in the course.</p> <p>If you have at least some DC experience and the reading is being absorbed easily, you could become fully prepared by taking the DCDC Online Test Preparation Course, where you\u2019ll receive flash cards, practice quizzes for each chapter, and a full practice exam. As I mentioned in the Introduction, this is the route I took via the course and material bundle, and I felt very prepared on the exam day.</p> <p>The exam itself is 100 questions, consisting of \u201cmultiple choice questions with two correct answers, drag and drop, and hot spot identification,\u201d and you\u2019ll have two hours to complete it. The tests are administered by Pearson VUE, so all of the usual recommendations for scheduling and preparing for exam day apply. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully!</p> <p>Beyond the technicalities of applying and sitting for the exam, there are no easy ways to ensure you pass. One of the most helpful things I was told is to be careful not to think about the questions from your experience in the field; give the answer BICSI expects, instead. The longer you work in the field, the more you\u2019ll rely on your opinions and experience that you\u2019ve earned in the field, but this may conflict with what certifying bodies want to hear. Never forget that!</p> <p>The surefire way to pass, however, is to upgrade your learning tools, techniques, and habits. I created an ICT study guide that I\u2019ve used to successfully pass a large number of certifications on the first try, and I\u2019m confident it will work for you, too. These methods will not only give you the skills needed to pass the exam, but to retain and maintain that knowledge while working in your new career.</p> <p>Good luck, and let me know how you do!</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-osp-designer-certification-review/","title":"Certification Review: BICSI Outside Plant (OSP) Designer","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>Originally published on October 19, 2022 on Medium, now updated and hosted here.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-osp-designer-certification-review/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The BICSI Outside Plant (OSP) Designer certification was developed to help OSP engineers design and build outside plant facilities on either private property or the public Right of Way (ROW).

At 960 pages, it\u2019s a long and intense read, but it\u2019s packed with critical information that\u2019s aligned with the exam objectives. From what I was told, the OSPDRM began as an OSP manual for customer-owned premises in 1999, and has evolved to a more all-inclusive reference.</p> <p>In addition to the OSPDRM, there are several training courses you can take to further your knowledge. OSP 101: Introduction to Outside Plant Design is for OSP people that are new to the field and need to learn the basics. It\u2019s designed as a self-paced online course. For more advanced training, there\u2019s OSP 102: Applied Outside Plant Design. This is a live (in-person or virtual) five day intensive training that reviews all the concepts in the OSPDRM and then applies them in practical design exercises that each build on the next. Although I was new to OSP when I found these resources, I went with OSP 102 to quickly immerse myself and increase my understanding. I thoroughly enjoyed the training.</p> <p>There are some official OSP flash cards included in the OSP 102 course, but they are not available as a standalone purchase as they are with the DCDC or included in the RCDD Exam Prep Course. As a result, you are on your own in assessing and developing your study materials from the OSPDRM and available courses. I\u2019ll discuss studying strategies more below.</p> <p>I want to note that I generally focus on official materials for these reviews, being either directly produced by the issuer of the credential or formally recognized third parties.

Now in it\u2019s sixth edition, released in 2018, the BICSI OSPDRM is used internationally as a definitive reference for outside plant design.</p> <p>In the OSPDRM, \u201cBICSI defines OSP as the telecommunications infrastructure that is designed and installed externally to buildings and typically routed into an entrance facility.\u201d This includes both short haul and long haul networks, with plant \u201ccabling\u201d including \u201ccopper, optical fiber, wireless, or coaxial\u201d for short haul networks and \u201coptical fiber, wireless, or satellite provisioning\u201d for long haul networks.</p> <p>BICSI further defines OSP designers as those \u201cresponsible for designing the interbuilding cabling and entrance facility (EF) infrastructure and the termination of the OSP cabling.\u201d To perform these responsibilities, designers are expected to be competent in the following:</p> <ul> <li>Pathways and spaces</li> <li>Cabling (cable and connecting hardware)</li> <li>Bonding and grounding (earthing)</li> <li>Right-of-way (R/W)</li> <li>System documentation</li> <li>Applicable codes and standards</li> </ul> <p>Overall, the OSPDRM covers these competencies well. Spanning 959 pages in length, it certainly is comprehensive in scope on these topics. The chapters included cover:</p> <ol> <li>Introduction to Outside Plant</li> <li>Cable and Connector Types</li> <li>Cabling Topologies</li> <li>Pathways and Spaces</li> <li>Splicing Hardware</li> <li>Bonding and Grounding (Earthing) and Electrical Protection</li> <li>Right-of-Way</li> <li>Project Design</li> <li>Maintenance and Restoration</li> <li>Other Technologies</li> </ol> <p>and it includes appendices on</p> <ul> <li>Codes, Standards, Regulations, and Organizations</li> <li>Legal Considerations</li> <li>Cement and Concrete Applications</li> <li>Balanced Twisted-Pair Splice Closure Configuration</li> </ul> <p>as well as a glossary, bibliography, and index.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-ospdrm-resource-review/#where-can-you-get-it","title":"Where Can You Get It?","text":"<p>The BICSI OSPDRM is available from BICSI\u2019s website. As of this video, the digital-only version retails for $255 for BICSI members and $300 for non-members. You can order a hard copy or digital and hard copy bundle as well.</p> <p>I originally ordered the bundle, because as much as I appreciate some the advantages of ebooks, I still love having hard copies of my most essential reading material, as you can see behind me. But after working with the 959 page binder for several days, I decided to break it down into chunks within multiple, more manageable-sized binders.</p> <p>The digital version comes as a web-based ebook. BICSI\u2019s digital publications are actually pretty usable, including full text searching, offline access, built-in highlighting and notes, plus you can access it from anywhere. I\u2019m fortunate enough right now to work from home quite a lot, but when I\u2019m in the office or even the field I still have access to this reference.</p> <p>So while I love a good hard copy book, I\u2019ve found myself using the digital publications more often for the convenience and, quite honestly, because many of the hard copy binders are just not easily accessible. If you have the 14th Edition of the Telecommunications Distribution Methods Manual, you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about.</p> <p>BICSI publications will be updated from time to time in an errata document, but there are none for the OSPDRM at the time of this article. Because of the speed of changes in our industry, and this manual already being four years old, there are some areas where it will begin to show its age. I\u2019ll cover some of those areas later in the article.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-ospdrm-resource-review/#where-does-this-resource-excel-and-fall-short","title":"Where Does This Resource Excel and Fall Short?","text":"<p>As expected, each chapter offers an informative overview of the topic, but like anything, some areas are better covered than others. To help you determine whether this resource is worth using, I\u2019ll give a usually quick summary of each, adding some commentary where it excels or falls short, and mention other resources that might fill the gaps.</p> <p>Chapter 1, Introduction to Outside Plant, provides a brief but solid outline of what OSP is and what is involved from an OSP designer\u2019s perspective. If you\u2019re new to OSP, this will provide you with a good idea of where you\u2019re heading. It\u2019s short and sweet, overall.</p> <p>Chapter 2, Cable and Connector Types, summarizes fiber, twisted pair, and coaxial cabling and their respective connectors well, too. I especially appreciated a comprehensive walk-through of fiber link loss budgeting, however testing and fiber characterization should have gotten more treatment.</p> <p>Attenuation is important, but chromatic dispersion and polarization modal dispersion are as well. In general, designing cable plant for anything over 1 Gbps requires serious testing, and anything over 10 Gbps requires full scale characterization, especially for middle mile and long haul routes.</p> <p>Another shortcoming that I noticed was around the discussion of the types of singlemode fiber. OS1 and OS2 are generic names for singlemode fiber that have more to do with the overall cable performance and not the optical fibers inside, which are indicated based on the ITU designations, such as G.652.</p> <p>I found the OSPDRM to be much more heavy on twisted pair but light on singlemode specs and applications. There are many different types of singlemode and specific applications that each is best suited for (remember the ITU designations), and like testing, is essential information for the OSP designer.</p> <p>Fortunately I found other resources that addressed these shortcomings\u2014namely the Fiber Optic Association\u2019s Certified Fiber Optic Specialist in Testing (CFOS/T) course and Optical Technology Training\u2019s Certified Optical Network Associate (CONA) and Certified Optical Network Engineer (CONE) courses\u2014so keep an eye out as I\u2019ll talk more about those in upcoming reviews.</p> <p>Chapter 3, Cabling Topologies, covers the many topologies possible for a cable plant and their pros and cons, including hybrid fiber coax (HFC) and passive optical network (PON) systems. I personally enjoy thinking topologically about my designs, and it\u2019s all good stuff here.</p> <p>Chapter 4, Pathways and Spaces, in my opinion, is by far the longest and most comprehensive part of the manual, going in-depth on direct burial, underground, and aerial pathways, along with the spaces involved in-between each. To give you a sense, it\u2019s about 25% of the entire manual\u2019s pages! It\u2019s so large and I\u2019ve referenced it so much I put it in it\u2019s own binder.</p> <p>When you\u2019re just getting started in trying to understand and design the OSP, this is your go-to guide, and where BICSI\u2019s OSPDRM definitely excels. It\u2019s well organized, with helpful illustrations to visualize key concepts, make-ready management strategies, and references common NESC requirements for compliance purposes.</p> <p>Overall, each pathway gets good treatment of what I\u2019ll call conventional OSP design. Now despite all that, because of how important this chapter is, I want to cover some significant shortcomings that I hope can be improved in the next edition.</p> <p>The first up is microtrenching. I was happy to see it briefly mentioned, but given the growing demand for fiber density, particularly in already congested urban areas, I was hoping for full treatment. The OSPDRM\u2019s acknowledgement does help give the method credibility, but with the recent introduction of purpose-built materials and equipment, I believe it should now be treated as a first-class pathway.</p> <p>Traditional trenching for underground networks serving campus, FTTX, and 5G endpoints is often too cost prohibitive, so OSP designers need to know these modern approaches to excavation to deliver cost-effective solutions to their clients. Using microtrenching, which I consider to include pavement saw cutting and vibratory plowing, you can create entire underground pathways across the distribution and access networks, all the way to the premises.</p> <p>But designing and building it right requires guidance around the many pitfalls, as well as the stiff opposition from many AHJs. BICSI has an opportunity to offer that guidance and boost the credibility in the interest of its OSP design community.</p> <p>The second shortcoming I\u2019d love to see improved is general design best practices in dense urban environments. As I mentioned above, designers face congested underground and aerial pathways. Microtrenching is a promising solution for congested underground, but make-ready on aerial pathways creates a more limited, and sometimes more expensive constraint.</p> <p>Designers also face restrictions on the creation of new pathways such as in downtowns or campus environments, regardless of congestion levels. In these areas, AHJs place these limitations mainly for aesthetic purposes, and this can create significant challenges. Restrictions on pole placement are common in these areas, for example, as many consider them unsightly.</p> <p>In such areas, like a dense urban neighborhood, distribution cabling is usually routed through existing duct banks to each block, and then run across each building\u2019s exterior. You\u2019ll see this approach in nearly every city without aerial pathways. There is no guidance for such designs, even though there are approaches to these challenges.</p> <p>For dense areas where new aerial pathways are allowed, I would have appreciated more pole setting and guying guidance in these environments, too, as setting new pole lines in sidewalks and alleyways are full of challenges. Other options, such as fiber through water or sewer pipes, are now becoming feasible to meet the growing demand for more fiber, and the OSPDRM should pay attention to such advancements.</p> <p>The third shortcoming is the lack of long-haul and back-haul route discussions. If anything is central to OSP it is long-haul routes, and designing one requires an understanding of optical transmission constraints and the placement of spaces and equipment necessary for signal amplification or regeneration. I think the OSPDRM is incomplete without coverage of long-haul routes.</p> <p>I\u2019m particularly disappointed that one of my favorite types of long-haul, submarine cabling, wasn\u2019t covered. I recognize that subsea is probably too complex, but freshwater lake or river crossings should be discussed in detail. Think of how many practical questions new designers might have about this topic:</p> <ul> <li>How do you transition from conduit to the water?</li> <li>Where should the hand holes be placed along the shore?</li> <li>Must the cable be buried like it is in subsea crossings?</li> <li>How do you plan for maintenance and repair of the crossings?</li> <li>What cable specifications should even be used for such applications?</li> </ul> <p>I believe submarine crossings are different enough from underground and direct burial that it could be added as a fourth pathway with general recommendations.</p> <p>Terrestrial and submarine long-haul wireline routes (over 80 km) are obviously a crucial aspect that OSP designers must be familiar with, but I\u2019d like to see proper coverage of wireless, too. Going back to BICSI\u2019s definition of OSP, wireless is considered a type of cabling for both short and long-haul networks, so OSP designers should be given guidance on these topics.</p> <p>Wireless long-haul is commonly called back-haul, and having vendor-neutral wireless back-haul best practices seems like an important thing to standardize. There are many regions where portions of routes are difficult to get through with underground or aerial pathways because of the terrain, and high speed point-to-point wireless bridges between fiber can be utilized. And even if the entire wireline plant can be built out, having wireless back-haul as route diversity can build resiliency into critical network operations.</p> <p>Wireless short-haul coverage of fixed wireless access and distribution design should be included, as well. To my knowledge, there is no vendor-neutral standard for designing these topologies, and as wireless ISPs (WISPs) are building out across the World to address network access deficiencies, BICSI could take a lead here to produce that standard. AHJs that oversee or finance this infrastructure could then require compliance to ensure a high quality and reliable network is built.</p> <p>Alright, this is my last shortcoming of Chapter 4: weak coverage of entrance facilities. On page 1-1 of the OSPDRM, it literally states that \u201cBICSI defines OSP as the telecommunications infrastructure that is designed and installed externally to buildings and typically routed into an entrance facility (EF).\u201d It goes on to state on page 6-2 that \u201cOSP systems are not just limited to being external to a building. In many jurisdictions, the OSP designer will also be responsible for the design and provisioning of cabling and pathways to where OSP cable is transitioned to approved inside cabling.\u201d Based on these statements, entrances facilities are a fundamental part of OSP, so designers should be given substantial guidance on working with them, right?</p> <p>Unfortunately, no. EFs are first discussed briefly in Chapter 4 on pages 252-3 as a sub-header that spans about a page in length and in very generic terms within the Concrete Universal Enclosure (CUE) section. They\u2019re again discussed in Chapter 6 in the context of bonding &amp; grounding for eight pages (starting on 6-34). This is eight times the amount spent on designing and installing them!</p> <p>New designers will have lots of questions regarding entrance facilities as they start to work on projects, such as:</p> <ul> <li>How do you enter an older building without existing pathways?</li> <li>What do you do if the existing pathways to the EF are either congested or restricted?</li> <li>What if there is no proper EF in the building (many old building are like this), just random mechanical spaces that comms were haphazardly run to?</li> <li>What are the tradeoffs between aerial and underground pathways to the EF?</li> <li>When and how do you transition between OSP and ISP (premises) cabling?</li> <li>What are the best practices based on site type? How about a home? A hut? A campus? A data center? A cell site?</li> </ul> <p>Proper entrance facilities into the wide range of buildings from the OSP is a core aspect of design work. EFs are crucial to get right the first time, no matter the site type. Once that plant is passed through to the premises and put into production, you don\u2019t want problems down the road.</p> <p>Recognizing that risk while I was trying to understand and design EFs, I turned to the TIA-569 standard on telecommunications pathways and spaces for guidance. That\u2019s probably your best resource on entrances facilities at this point. If there\u2019s enough interest, I may do a resource review about it.</p> <p>Alright, so that was a lot of feedback on Chapter 4! Was it helpful? Please give me feedback so I know how much of a deep dive you want in these reviews. Before we move ahead to the next chapter, I want to make note of something that\u2019s come out since the release of the current OSPDRM that hopefully will start to address the shortcomings above.</p> <p>In 2017, BICSI released the G1-17, ICT Outside Plant Construction and Installation: General Practices standard. This was the first of a \u201cseries of standards written to provide a common methodology for the construction and installation of telecommunication and data cabling used within the outside plant (OSP) environment, for varying applications, jurisdictions and projects.\u201d I found it pretty vague, unfortunately; it seems more like a draft version, with only outlines in many places.</p> <p>In 2022, however, two additions to series were released: G2.1-22, ICT Outside Plant Construction and Installation: Pole Setting, Anchoring, and Guying, and G2.2-22, ICT Outside Plant Construction and Installation: Aerial Cable Installation. Both are much more comprehensive than the OSPDRM, and I recommend you grab them now that they\u2019re available.</p> <p>I really like where things are going here, and I see an opportunity for BICSI to address the above shortcomings like microtrenching, long-haul, wireless, and entrance facilities in subsequent standards. So far, I\u2019m impressed with these standards and will be adopting them for my designs. If there\u2019s enough interest in learning more about them, I\u2019ll add these to the resource review queue.</p> <p>Chapter 5, Splicing Hardware, covers the basics of OSP closures and the twisted pair or optical fiber components and equipment necessary to splice cables together inside of those closures. Now I\u2019m an optical network engineer and don\u2019t deal with any coaxial, fortunately, but I was surprised that there wasn\u2019t any discussion of it here.</p> <p>In chapters 2 and 3 coaxial cables and hybrid fiber coax were covered, so it should make sense to discuss the related closures and termination components here. I don\u2019t have any recommendations of where else to look, unfortunately, but drop me a comment if you do.</p> <p>This was the only shortcoming I saw, keeping in mind that this is a broad topic to cover properly, and you\u2019re going to rely mainly on the manufacturers of your materials and equipment for specific guidance. Also, depending on your role, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere to develop the skills necessary, like splicing, to install them. I have a lot of skill-building certification content coming up, things that helped me get strong on the technician fundamentals, so keep an eye out for that.</p> <p>Chapter 6, Bonding and Grounding (Earthing) and Electrical Protection, covers one of the most important aspects of designing a network from a life, property, and equipment safety perspective. Your plant needs protective systems against risks like lightning, contact with supply circuits, ground potential rise, and even electromagnetic interference. This chapter covers it all.</p> <p>Bonding and grounding wasn\u2019t originally something I was familiar with, and not a common part of my daily design work, so it was one of the tougher areas for me on the exam. But this chapter does a great job of covering all the aspects. So whether you have to grab your references every time or are completely comfortable with grounding and bonding concepts, read this chapter carefully and make sure you follow code requirements and best practices for the plant.</p> <p>Chapter 7, Right-of-Way, gives readers a thorough overview of the considerations when designing plant in the right-of-way. If you\u2019re fortunate enough to focus solely on customer-owned OSP, such as on campuses or at data centers, good for you! Your job should be a lot easier.</p> <p>For the rest of us, however, you better understand navigating the challenges of obtaining right-of-way to get your plant from here to there from anywhere. As the OSPDRM explains on p. 7-1, \u201cThe (right-of-way) acquisition process can be one of the greatest factors that affects a project\u2019s schedule \u2026 If one small segment of an OSP route is not properly authorized, then that segment becomes the weakest link and prevents the entire OSP project from proceeding.\u201d You definitely want to be solid on this topic.</p> <p>Overall, the coverage of right-of-way in the OSPDRM is thorough and introduces the designer to all necessary considerations. You\u2019ll learn what the different types of right-of-way are, how to acquire rights through tools like permits, licenses, or easements, and how to identify and describe the real estate you need access to. Follow the recommendations and you\u2019ll avoid a lot of the pitfalls that exist in this aspect of OSP design.</p> <p>But there still some shortcomings that I\u2019ve identified from my six years of experience in the field. Here are some of the most important aspects missing from the chapter that I\u2019ve had to deal with.</p> <p>First up are two of the most common types of right-of-way acquisitions that OSP designers will deal with: pole and conduit agreements, often known as joint use agreements. Unless you fully own all the pathways you use, you\u2019ll often need to ask another facility owner to attach to their poles or enter their conduits. And to do this properly, you\u2019ll need joint use agreements, and permits for individuals pole attachments and linear conduit footage.</p> <p>Do not install plant on or in third party facilities without properly issued permits; best case you\u2019ll have to pay fines and make ready, and worse case you\u2019ll have to remove the plant and could lose your agreement altogether. Either case puts your design in jeopardy and can cause serious setbacks on your project.</p> <p>If you have joint use agreements, ensure your permitting accounts for all related facility use, and verify your records regularly with the facility owner. If you don\u2019t have joint use agreements, it could be a lengthy process to get them, so initiate that process early wherever you may need to build out across. Even if you acquire facilities or receive authorization to use existing facilities from a third party, ensure they have permitting in order before proceeding with any project.</p> <p>A second aspect you need to be clear on is the AHJ for the right-of-way, and the multiple dimensions associated with rights-of-way along any route. There are often multiple, even overlapping rights of way that can surface during a design.</p> <p>A basic example of this is the right-of-way alongside a state road. In some areas, the municipality will define a right-of-way alongside its streets, but where a state road passes through that municipality, the state AHJ such as the Department of Transportation may have the final authority to issue permits per its regulations.</p> <p>I\u2019ll give you another example in permitting for what I call complex crossings such as highways, railroads, rivers, or bridges. The OSPDRM does do a good job addressing rail crossings, which can be some of the most difficult permits to get, but in some cases the state PUC may actually be the AHJ there. Here in Pennsylvania that is true, as well as for bridges. In that case, you may already be permitted to attach to the poles that you use to cross the track or dip under the bridge, but here you\u2019ll also need separate state permitting to perform the crossing.</p> <p>Alright, that\u2019s enough on that. The bottom line is make sure you\u2019re never wrong about the right-of-way, OK?</p> <p>Chapter 8, Project Design, covers the project management aspect of OSP design\u2014yet another aspect of the work that you as a designer are going to have to master to become successful. OSP projects by their nature are usually quite complicated, and you really don\u2019t want to find your mistakes after the plant has been built. You\u2019ll be relieved to know that the OSPDRM does a very good job of laying out the pitfalls, considerations, checklists, and processes to keep your projects on track.</p> <p>At this point in the review you\u2019ll probably also be relieved to know that I can\u2019t think of any shortcomings to get into. In fact, I want to heap some more praise on BICSI here because of the well-deserved coverage of geographic information systems (GIS) as an excellent way to perform both your design work as well as the day-to-day O&amp;M activities necessary to keep the plant in production.</p> <p>Down the road I plan to talk a lot more about OSP design using GIS, and it\u2019s encouraging to have BICSI endorsing the approach as well. Having Python and SQL mentioned in the OSPDRM for OSP automation was a pleasant surprise, and I\u2019ll have a lot to discuss about that in the future.</p> <p>Chapter 9, Maintenance and Restoration, is a new addition to the sixth edition of the manual, and covers routine maintenance, demand maintenance, emergency restoration, and disaster recovery. As a designer, it\u2019s essential to understand these activities and proactively design the network to facilitate them all whenever required.</p> <p>Included in each section of the chapter is a general overview and lists of the top considerations and scenarios all designers should be aware of. This includes several processes and procedures for emergency outages and disaster recovery preparation and response, which are risks your plant will unfortunately face every day. It\u2019s best to design with that expectation in mind.</p> <p>Chapter 10, Other Technologies, adds new material to the manual on the topics of Radio Frequency over Glass (RFoG), Passive Optical Networks (PONs), and fiber optic intrusion detection and alarm systems. Each of these topics could be its own chapter, or more likely its own manual, so consider them to be introductions as you\u2019ll need to seek out other resources.</p> <p>The section on RFoG is very short, at about half a page, but the PON section is more substantial. Now I have no experience with designing RFoG, but I\u2019m guessing a good place to start for more information would be the Society of Cable Telecommunications Engineers\u2019 (SCTE) website.</p> <p>PON on the other hand, is something I\u2019ve been designing for years, and I\u2019d recommend checking out the Fiber Broadband Association\u2019s (FBA) Certified Fiber to the Home Professional (CFHP) program for that. My next certification review will be this credential, so stay tuned to learn more about this excellent program.</p> <p>Regarding intrusion detection and alarm systems, I don\u2019t yet have any experience in this, but I would love to monitor attenuation on every route enough to know if someone\u2019s tampering with a hand hole. I think the best place to start here would be the Fiber Optic Sensing Association (FOSA), which was established in 2017 to help promote and advance this exciting optical technology.</p>"},{"location":"blog/bicsi-ospdrm-resource-review/#do-you-recommend-it","title":"Do You Recommend It?","text":"<p>Alright, that was a pretty long review. If you\u2019re still following along, you\u2019re a die hard OSP designer and must be as passionate about pathways as I am. Or maybe you want to be. In either case, you probably want to know if the OSPDRM is for you. As I\u2019ll probably say each review, every resource excels and falls short in different ways. However, the OSPDRM remains the best overall guide to OSP design, hands down. But let me add some context to that.</p> <p>Since the first telephone wires were laid across the U.S., OSP has existed as a field, and it\u2019s an essential part of the modern network infrastructure. But for decades the institutional knowledge on it was contained within the telecom companies, and both standards and training manuals were company specific.</p> <p>When telecom was partially deregulated and large companies were broken up, private OSP engineering and construction firms stepped in, and the BICSI OSPDRM emerged. But there is still a lot of hard-earned wisdom stored up in the the seasoned engineers within the telecom companies, and many of them are now retiring. I was told by someone at a private OSP firm that they used to have a steady stream of retired OSP engineers they could use for projects, but those numbers are starting to decline.</p> <p>I believe that the OSPDRM must capture that institutional knowledge for next generation of OSP designers who, like myself, entered the field from outside of the traditional telecom engineering path, and equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to build the next generation of networks. Fortunately the OSPDRM is written by a team of veterans of the trade that volunteer their time to maintain it, so there\u2019s still time to distill that wisdom.</p> <p>But everything continues to move faster and faster, and the OSPDRM will have to keep pace to fill those gaps and update existing materials. For example, the 2023 National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) standard was released in August of 2022 and goes into effect next February, so the OSPDRM is already outdated on a very important topic that spans multiple chapters. This could be added as errata in the near future, and I\u2019ll be sure to note that here on my blog.</p> <p>As an OSP designer, you just need to be aware of that issue even with the best resources available to you, and keep current on the rapid changes that, for better or for worse, are part of our industry. OSP is a challenging thing to keep pace with, as the technology accelerates but the resources often lag behind. The OSPDRM will get you started, experience will allow you to grow, and hopefully content like this will help you out along the way.</p>"},{"location":"blog/a-fresh-start-with-some-old-posts/","title":"A Fresh Start with Some Old Posts","text":"<p>It's time to start writing again.

I was born and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania, and I spent the majority of my life living in and working to improve my hometown. On November 30th, 2015, I plead guilty to one count of Conspiracy to Commit Bribery in Federal court, and became a felon for my actions as a public official of the City of Reading.</p> <p>Having my career and much of my life\u2019s work end this way was a heartbreaking and personally devastating experience for me and my family. It was a shock to the many friends and allies I worked closely with on nearly a decade of efforts, and signaled the end of what I hoped to be a lifetime of public service continuing the work I started in the city.</p> <p>It\u2019s now been nine years since that happened and, despite the hardship I experienced, I believe I\u2019m a much better person having gone through what I did. It was the most costly education I\u2019ve ever paid for, but I would not give up what I\u2019ve learned to go back in time and avoid it.

I\u2019ve since learned of the multiple personal weaknesses I had during this time, as well as the larger systemic issues that influenced everything that happened, and these are the areas I\u2019ve decided to focus my energy on changing. If you know corruption must end and want a TL;DR shortcut to my perspective on what must be done, please jump to Part 4.</p> <p>I\u2019m not here to make excuses for myself or anyone else involved. If nothing else, may my experience be a lesson for those that now walk the same path that I did, and may they avoid the pitfalls along the way. More than sharing a cautionary tale, however, my ambition is to contribute towards fixing the problems at the core of corruption.</p> <p>Corruption is not just human nature, although ego and arrogance certainly fuel it. It\u2019s a systemic failure of policies and institutions that can destroy our most altruistic efforts to improve human life, such as deepening democracy, expanding economic opportunities and infrastructure, and even protecting the planet.</p> <p>Essentially, if allowed to exist, corruption can and will hijack a society\u2019s most important functions within government, religion, business, and beyond, and redirect society\u2019s collective goals to a singular goal of the concentration of money and power. It\u2019s a simple yet terrifying fact.</p> <p>Corruption is often compared to a cancer, but that may not be an accurate analogy. Perhaps a virus is more accurate, because I believe it can spread from person to person with just an exchange of cash. Whatever disease you want to compare it to, it appears as an infection that we continually attempt to remove when it\u2019s detected.</p> <p>But like John Snow and the Broad Street pump, if we continue to treat the symptoms, and not the cause, the most important goals of society will continue to become terminally ill and die. From my hard-earned perspective and experience, we\u2019re a lot closer to that point than most people realize.</p> <p>I appreciate your interest in my story.

His office and the U.S. Court system Pre-Trial Services staff were very supportive during this supervisory period, and I am very grateful for that.</p> <p>I was determined to stabilize my life and stay positive and productive while waiting for the trial and my subsequent sentencing. Despite having spent nearly all of my professional life in public service, I accepted the fact that my career there was over and, feeling awash with shame, I wanted to just lay low in general. But I needed work, and I needed anything else that would take my mind off what was happening to me. I would need to reinvent myself again.</p> <p>Tapping my passion for analytical thinking and technology, I decided to pursue a Masters degree in Data Science, and by December 31, 2015, I was accepted at Lewis University as a full-time graduate student. Further leveraging my technical and analytical skills, I was recruited to work as a business analyst for a local telecommunications service provider in the Spring of 2016.</p> <p>In addition to now having a steady income and educational goals, I was able to finally concentrate on decompressing and detoxifying all the stress that was slowly eating me alive.

At his plea hearing, he pleaded not guilty. My heart sank, knowing this was going to trial.</p> <p>It took a long time to get to the trial of Mayor Spencer, where I would be needed to testify as a witness for the prosecution. I\u2019d get notices of a change in date, anxieties would flood my mind and I\u2019d clear my calendar in preparation, only to have it postponed again. On August 27th, 2018, however, that day finally came. To give some context, I graduated with my M.S. in Data Science from Lewis University just the day before. It had been nearly three years since my plea hearing, and I was more than ready.</p> <p>All court activities took place in Philadelphia. About a year before the FBI raid, I remembered visiting an adjacent federal building to talk with officials there about sustainability. It\u2019s remarkable to think about how time and circumstances can shift your experiences in the very same location. Entering the courthouse with my family and my legal team, we were escorted to a waiting room for witnesses. I was told that one of Spencer\u2019s campaign consultants was on the stand, and inside were his belongings, including his cell phone.</p> <p>Seeing his phone, I was immediately flooded with memories of his incessant, exhausting phone calls and texts, pressuring me to do things I didn\u2019t want to. Most of the time I could ignore him, and I did my best to avoid him, but obviously that strategy failed in the end. Four years ago, I would have been enraged with even the sight of his belongings, much less being within 100 ft. of him, but I maintained my composure, focused on my breath, and focused on what I was there to do.</p> <p>To me, this consultant embodied someone with a great deal of suffering, visible in the way he thought, spoke, and acted. In the end, he was still a teacher, and through our interactions and the consequences that followed, I learned important lessons about myself, as well as how to better deal with a person like him. I hope he\u2019s found peace and a better path through life having been given a second chance.</p> <p>When it was my turn to appear on the stand, I looked out across the courtroom as I sat down. My eyes went first to my family, and then to the defense table, where I saw Vaughn Spencer for the first time in over four years. I believed he and I developed a strong bond through the many highs and lows of our time working together, but after years of reflection I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that it wasn\u2019t a healthy relationship. I should have stepped down from my position and left the administration a long time ago. If I had, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been sitting where I was that day. I\u2019ll talk more about that later.</p> <p>I shifted my eyes away from Spencer and then to the jury box. While my fate remained directly with the judge, these jurors would be the ones to ultimately rule on Spencer\u2019s fate. My duty was to honestly and openly recollect what happened for their benefit. I then looked at the prosecution\u2019s table and awaited their questions.</p> <p>My time on the stand felt like forever, but I maintained a sense of calm and control. I answered all questions asked by both the prosecution and defense as best I could, tapping memories of people, places, and events I had been suppressing this entire time. I was questioned for roughly five hours, including a lunch break in-between. My main hope was to only have to do this once; returning to the witness stand because the trial ran out of time that day was not something I wanted to face.</p> <p>Fortunately, my testimony covered everything to both sides\u2019 satisfaction that day. Relieved, I returned home happy with my handling of the third most difficult day of my life (the second was yet to come). I\u2019m not going to recount all the details of the trial that day, but you can read here and also here for good summaries from some of the journalists that were present.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#facing-the-future","title":"Facing the\u00a0Future","text":"<p>On April 1, 2019, the second hardest day of my life arrived: my sentencing hearing, where the judge would decide my final penalty for my offenses, taking into consideration both the prosecution\u2019s recommendations and the defense\u2019s allocution statement. Returning to the courthouse this time were my family and I, my attorneys, as well as a group of some of my closest friends and nearly all my colleagues from work. I was prepared for the worst, but still hoped for the best outcome.</p> <p>Appearing before the Hon. Chief Justice Juan R. S\u00e1nchez again, I stood up and began reading my allocution statement. I felt I was thoroughly prepared and my statement was good enough to read out loud in court, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough to share as-is publicly. Instead, I decided to use it as the basis for this entire piece, and it contributed to the content in many ways.</p> <p>While reading it, and with the judge listening intently, my attorney quietly signaled me to wrap it up, even though I was barely through half of the carefully worded statements. Confused, I trailed off in my statements and thanked the court for the chance to speak. Shaka Johnson looked at me reassuringly, and we sat down as the prosecutors prepared to speak next.</p> <p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan, speaking on behalf of the federal government, gave several brief statements recognizing the extent of my cooperation with the prosecution, and asked for a significant downward departure from what the Federal Sentencing Guidelines determine when calculating an offender\u2019s punishment.</p> <p>I was caught off guard, as the prosecution seemed to be recommending the exact reduced sentence we\u2019d been hoping for, which I read was uncommon. I looked at Shaka to get confirmation, to which he smiled knowingly, and I then realized why he shortened my allocution statement. And with that, the judge accepted the downward departure and sentenced me to six months of house arrest, a $7,600 fine, and five years of probation.</p> <p>I thanked the court and prosecution, hugged everyone with relief in my party, and returned home knowing that the worst was finally over. Throughout my ordeal, I was never in handcuffs, and never placed in a prison cell. As difficult as it was to endure the entire process, it could have been much, much worse.</p> <p>Six months later, I was authorized to cut off my ankle bracelet, began visiting people and places I\u2019d missed, and was even able to still make my annual silent retreat organized by Dharmapunx NYC in the beautiful Hudson River Valley in upstate NY. Besides my remaining time on probation, my sentence is now behind me and I\u2019m otherwise thriving better than I ever did while working for the City.</p> <p>Today I can safely look back on what happened with wisdom and humility, and look forward with courage and confidence knowing that I am firmly rooted and ready for the future.

The City announced an art contest for the logo of a new anti-littering initiative named Reading Beautification, and the schools encouraged students to submit ideas. I enjoyed drawing, and decided to participate, and was selected as the winning entry.</p> <p>That Spring, the winner was announced during Reading\u2019s annual Earth Day celebration, and I was invited to accept an award presented by Mayor Warren Haggerty at the bandshell in City Park. He asked me to speak, and I went on some rambling lecture about littering, but after that I felt proud to see my logo throughout the city on signposts. A seed of civic duty and impact was implanted in me.</p> Left photo is one of many signs still visible around city, by the author, 2021. Right image is the original letter to the author from Reading Beautification, Inc., dated May 5, 1993, after being recognized for my contribution (courtesy of my parents). <p>I soon became rooted in public service and municipal government as a teenager. Starting in 1994, I spent my summers as a lifeguard at Schlegel Park pool, which is a public pool managed by the City\u2019s then Bureau of Recreation, which made me a City employee. Throughout these early years I enjoyed public service as a City employee, each summer working to improve the pool for both the patrons and staff.</p> <p>After generally struggling to find my identify and fit in while in 9th and 10th grade, I continued my course to become more civic minded while in high school. I spent my junior and senior years in Knight Life, RHS\u2019s audio/visual club, and enjoyed operating equipment behind the camera. I also had the privilege of getting in front of the camera regularly as a panelist on a joint venture between RHS and Berks Community Television (BCTV) entitled \u201cBridging the Generation Gap,\u201d a show that engaged students with adults on a variety of hot topics.</p> <p>I still rambled at times, but became increasingly more aware of social issues while finding my voice and the confidence to speak about them. It was one of my favorite activities during those years. I\u2019d like to thank Pastor Luther Routte and the other adults on the panel that would listen to us students and engage with our options and ideas. It was very encouraging for me to know that there were adults that valued my input.</p> <p>I got to know BCTV\u2019s director, Ann Sheehan, and became directly involved with BCTV when I started volunteering at their Internet Kiosk, where people could sign up to access the Web and have someone help them navigate this new experience. Around this time I myself got the privilege of accessing the Internet from home, and was eager to share what I was learning with others.</p> <p>While volunteering at BCTV I met Tom McMahon (who later would become mayor) and learned about a newly organized effort called the Berks Coalition for a Healthy Community (BCHC), an ambitious effort led by the Reading Hospital to bring together leaders from across the county as stakeholders working towards a shared vision.</p> <p>Fueling that vision was the \u201cBerks County Pierce Report,\u201d authored by Neil R. Pierce and Curtis W. Johnson, which weaved the county\u2019s past and future together, asking stakeholders to envision where Reading and Berks County will be in a decade. This report resonated with me, and would shape my own future efforts, which I\u2019ll discuss further below.</p> <p>I joined the BCHC and was recruited as a leader of the Youth Action Team, attending monthly meetings and even traveling to other areas for events. Through my time involved in BCHC, I was introduced to a number of influential community building concepts, particularly Kruger and McKnight\u2019s Asset-based Community Development (ABCD) model and related community indicator models. Reading suffered from a very negative reputation, which began to frustrate me the more I heard about it, and these approaches offered a new lens to viewing my community for its potential.</p> I volunteered as a leader of the Youth Action Team in the Berks Coalition for a Healthy Community during high school. It, too, was a very formative experience for me. Image again courtesy of my\u00a0parents. <p>The BCHC effort seemed to dissipate toward the end of my time in high school, and I began focusing more on what I planned to do after graduation, but I held onto that passion for community change. When I graduated from Reading High School (RHS) in 1998, I spent my last summer at Schlegel Park as pool manager. Less than a year later, I was hired by the Reading Public Library\u200a\u2014\u200aanother City function\u200a\u2014\u200aas the part-time webmaster/IT support person.

The 2000 election and 9/11 both had a profound impact on my life, and I quickly became a community activist while living in Lancaster City. I protested the Iraq War, participated in Neighborhood Watch, and became a disability rights advocate. Through all these activities, I increasingly realized the role politics plays in all outcomes; that \u201ccommunity building\u201d was just not enough. Electoral political became my focus.</p> <p>I learned of the Green Party from Ralph Nader\u2019s 2000 Election campaign and the \u201cspoiler effect\u201d debate that followed, and through my anti-war efforts I joined the local Green Party after realizing their values most closely matched my own. I became a political organizer, campaign manager, and party leader. Despite my efforts, we got nowhere. It felt like the system was rigged against us, and as I learned about the true nature of third parties in U.S. politics, and elections in general, I realized I was right.</p> <p>In parallel with my work with the Green Party, I had been using my technical skills to try and fix the issues with the election machines involved in the 2000 Election. After reading Black Box Voting, I joined the Open Voting Consortium (OVC), as a founding member and core developer of their innovative open source election machine that produced voter-verifiable paper ballots. Team members were encouraged to perform demos of the system across the country, so I held one at the Lancaster County Library. Like my work with the Green Party, however, our system never got the traction and attention it deserved.</p> <p>Through my frustrations as a political activist, I decided to further concentrate my efforts on political reform; simply \u201crunning for office\u201d and \u201cgetting out the vote\u201d is not enough. I grew disenchanted with technocratic solutions and believed more fundamental institutional reforms were the only answer. I planned to go back to school and study political science. I learned about electoral systems, such as proportional representation and instant runoff voting, and wanted to dig deep into these ideas.</p> <p>When Sarah graduated from Millersville University in the Spring of 2004, we got married and prepared to move to Massachusetts for her graduate work at UMass Amherst. On our honeymoon, my wonderful wife even allowed me to attend a voting symposium at Harvard University while we were looking for apartments. I started studying at Holyoke Community College and getting involved in political activities both on and off campus. One of my favorite authors on political reform, Douglas Amy, lived in the same community I did, and I had the privilege of sitting down with him and picking his brain. I felt I was right where I needed to be.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#returning-home-and-reinventing-reading","title":"Returning Home and Reinventing Reading","text":"<p>Plans often change, however, and Sarah and I decided to return home to be closer to our families after only six months in Massachusetts. Sarah began working at Berks Women in Crisis (now Safe Berks) while I continued my general studies at Reading Area Community College (RACC). We were committed to living in the city, and decided to buy a home. I learned about the Our City Reading organization, which rehabilitated blighted properties for first-time home buyers, so we entered the program and bought our first home. It was a very exciting moment.</p> <p>After returning home, however, I quickly grew disappointed in the state of the city. Conditions continued to decline, especially in the downtown, and the overall health of Reading displayed red flags on nearly every indicator. This was not the way it was supposed to be based on the vision in the 1996 Pierce Report. Living in Lancaster City, I saw a slow but steady improvement while I was there. Reading appeared to be going in the opposite direction.</p> <p>While working on my formal studies, I decided to pursue independent research into why my hometown continued to decline despite the many efforts of those before and after me to this point. I analyzed every article I could find in the Reading Eagle, spending most of my days in the libraries searching for answers to everything from low voter turnout to declining municipal revenue. I dreamed of writing a follow-up to the Pierce Report, factoring in the city\u2019s new reality as well as innovative ideas that could help.</p> <p>After researching and writing for a few months, I realized I\u2019d been compiling enough material to produce a full report, and I envisioned publishing this information in an accessible way for Reading\u2019s civic leaders to use as a reference guide for tackling the city\u2019s challenges. In the Spring of 2006, I released my document, entitled Reinventing Reading: A Comprehensive Vision and Framework for Revitalization, and made it freely available online. In it\u2019s final form, it was more like a book at nearly 150 pages, with a table of contents, index, and appendices. I was obviously quite proud of myself for accomplishing this.</p> <p>I submitted Reinventing Reading to Scribd, an early cloud-based document sharing site, in 2006, and updated it slightly again in 2008 to correct some of the URLs. This remains the official source for the paper.</p> <p></p> <p>I hand delivered a hard copy to Mayor Tom McMahon, and invited city council and others to a public presentation at RACC where I summarized my recommendations. Sadly it never really had the impact I envisioned. I was 26 at the time, and though many people were familiar with me, I never really engaged with anyone while writing it. I just sequestered myself with my research materials and PC for over a year like I was on a sabbatical while I wrote. At the time I believed I was just trying to help, but no one asked for another dense report, and some were skeptical of my agenda. I definitely may have appeared a bit pretentious, looking back.</p> <p>Nevertheless, my work had a profound impact on my own life. It affirmed my love for research and writing, especially on public policy topics. I also believed that economics might be a good fit for me, as so much of public policy seemed to be tied up around either how policies would be funded or affect the economy. Seeing how economics seemed to be the biggest challenge facing Reading, I turned my attention to that next.</p> <p>After releasing Reinventing Reading, I was also wrapping up my Associate\u2019s degree at RACC, and deciding where to transfer to pursue my Bachelor\u2019s in Economics. I wanted to continue studying locally, and Albright College looked like a good option, but I couldn\u2019t afford the tuition. While reviewing the enrollment process, I learned about the Eugene Shirk Scholarship, which would cover most of my costs each year, and was told that RACC students qualified. Eugene Shirk was a professor at Albright, a former mayor of the city, and even president of BCTV. I thought everything about that was awesome, and I immediately applied to Albright as well as for the scholarship, and got accepted and awarded the funding.</p> I was accepted into Albright College in 2006 as a Shirk Scholar based on my academic performance as well as my record of community service. I am forever grateful for opportunities like this that were given to me. Photo from the author\u2019s personal\u00a0archive. <p>I started classes at Albright in the Fall of 2006, and spent most of my time for the next year on my coursework, my part-time job, and working on our new home. During that time, however, I also became very interested in the Georgist school of economic thought, best known for the land value tax policy, and began collaborating with the Center for the Study of Economics in Philadelphia. In the Summer of 2007, I did an internship there as a economic policy analyst, and became quite passionate about the mission of the organization. That Fall, I started working part-time for the organization while I finished my degree.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#rebuilding-and-recovering-reading","title":"Rebuilding and Recovering Reading","text":"<p>Sarah began planning to return to school in 2008, and got accepted into Temple University\u2019s Doctoral program in Sociology starting that Fall. We moved down to Philadelphia in late Summer, and I began working full-time at the Center for the Study of Economics. Our focus was working with cities large and small on tax reform and public finance, and I got exposed to the political cultures of Manhattan Borough, Philadelphia, and other prospective places that we worked with. I found the work challenging but enjoyed the fast pace in that environment. At this point I felt that my time in Reading was probably complete; while I loved the idea of focusing on the local level, I\u2019d continue to advance policy at a larger scale. But things do have a way of coming full circle.</p> <p>In the Summer of 2009, I was contacted by Charles Corbett, who was serving on a blue ribbon panel created by Mayor McMahon to review the City\u2019s fiscal health, which had been steadily declining. Part of their charge was to determine whether the City should enter Act 47. Officially named the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act, Act 47 is designed to give financially distressed municipalities specific resources and powers to help avoid bankruptcy and gradually stabilize their fiscal health.</p> <p>Entering Act 47 includes many significant ramifications, including state oversight requirements, new tax revenue capabilities, and dramatic spending cuts to municipal operations. Charles asked the Center for the Study of Economics to speak to the panel about the land value tax and other revenue options to help stabilize the City budget without discouraging economic development. It was at this meeting that I met Lawrence Murin, a retired Labor leader and member of the panel, and whom I would continue to work closely with while at city hall.</p> <p>On October 6, 2009, I received an email from Stephen Glassman, Chair of the PA Human Relations Council, who requested my participation in a new initiative being launched by Mayor Tom McMahon. Recent Census data indicated Reading was now the sixth-poorest city in the nation, and the City wanted a community-led effort to identify ideas to combat the decline.</p> <p>I met with the mayor and other invitees the next day, and agreed to assist the newly-formed Rebuilding Reading Poverty Commission as its economic policy advisor, working closely with Glassman and Jane Palmer to guide the effort. The Commission spent the next year and a half holding hearings and working through its subcommittees to develop its recommendations, which were approved by both the mayor and city council and released as the Rebuilding Reading Poverty Report on March 19, 2011.</p> <p>In November, 2009, following the submission and review of the blue ribbon panel, Mayor McMahon initiated actions to enter the city into the Act 47 program. In response to the announcement, a large group of community leaders, including Council President Vaughn Spencer, Lawrence Murin, and other members of the previous blue ribbon panel, convened a meeting to decide how to ensure it had a voice in the process as a state-assigned oversight team was established and began holding local meetings to collect input.</p> <p>I was invited back as a representative of the Center for the Study of Economics for that initial meeting, and the group decided to organize into a grassroots initiative to provide input into the Act 47 plan. Shortly after that meeting, I parted ways with the Center for the Study of Economics, but stayed on as an independent member of the newly formed Act 47 Community Committee, and I would spend my time finishing my Bachelor\u2019s of Economics from Albright and traveling back and forth from Philadelphia to Reading to support both the poverty commission and community committee.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#another-journey-back-home","title":"Another Journey Back\u00a0Home","text":"<p>In the Spring of 2010, Sarah and I decided to again move back to Reading, as her graduate coursework was winding down and with all my energies devoted to Reading, it made little sense to remain in Philadelphia. In the weeks before we left, I attended a conference on composting (a strong personal interest of mine), which headlined Will Allen of Growing Power, who I was eager to hear speak. His story was so much more inspiring than I expected, and while waiting to meet him, I ran into two good friends of mine from Reading, Neil Brantley (now known as Ijendu Obasi) and Brian Twyman, and was introduced to Alexis Campbell.</p> <p>The three of them were there to also hear Allen speak, but also were exploring ways to collaborate on garden-based community development back in Reading. Ijendu had done incredible community gardens in the city, often with few resources, and Brian and Alexis also shared the same passion. Having already wanted some hands-on work in sustainability efforts in addition to my policy work, I agreed to help them set up a non-profit focused on permaculture education. Shortly after that, Permacultivate was born.</p> From right to left: A 2012 team photo of board members Sarah Jacobson, Brian Twyman, the author, Phil Wert, and several volunteers. Photo courtesy Sarah Jacobson, my\u00a0wife. <p>Motivated by the possibilities presented by Will Allen, we quickly set about acquiring resources and space in the city to begin our operation. Unfortunately Ijendu transitioned to another job outside of Reading, but we were able to recruit another good friend of mine and fellow permaculture expert, Phil Wert, as well as Lori Kaplan, who was also active in the gardening community in the city, to our board.</p> <p>Within a single year, our team secured the rights to use the vacant municipal greenhouse in City Park courtesy of Mayor McMahon, a 2.5 acre vacant lot near Canal St courtesy of the Reading Redevelopment Authority, and community garden plots courtesy of Berks Nature. We then started creating additional projects across the city, including an aquaponics station at the Millmont Elementary School and a garden sanctuary in a courtyard at Reading High School.</p> <p>In the Spring of 2011, I volunteered as a policy advisor to mayoral candidate Vaughn Spencer through his successful primary win, polishing work done by the Act 47 Community Committee during the campaign trail. In addition to Permacultivate, I also led the creation of the Sustainable Berks Business Network, modeled on the Sustainable Business Network of Philadelphia, which became a program of the New Creations Community Development Corporation, a Reading-based nonprofit. That year, I was also appointed by Reading City Council to the Reading Area Water Authority, and subsequently served as vice-chairman.</p> <p>By October of 2011, from community gardening to city planning, I had worked with a large number of incredible people working to improve the city and I felt excited about the future of Reading. Both the Rebuilding Reading Poverty Commission and Act 47 Community Committee had completed their work, some of which made it into the 2010 Act 47 recovery plan the City had to follow for the next five years.</p> <p>By this point I had accomplished a lot, figuratively planting every seed of positive change I could in an effort of helping improve my hometown. But I was spread thin, and getting burnt out. When I get overwhelmed I tend to want to just work with my hands, and digging in the dirt is a proven way to do that. But the problems in the city grew worse. The month prior, Reading moved from the sixth to the first poorest city in the U.S. I couldn\u2019t believe it, imagining places like Flint, MI, and Camden, NJ. This wasn\u2019t how Reading, coming from a rich industrial history, should be remembered.</p> <p>On November 8, 2011, Reading held its municipal elections, including the mayoral race. Candidate Spencer won, and became Mayor-Elect. I was appointed to the transition team, which as I learned is often a messy period involving a group of people in the candidate\u2019s political circle scrambling to evaluate the situation she or he will be facing upon taking office, as well as jockeying for possible positions serving with the candidate, or even, apparantly, dealing with campaign donors inserting themselves in upcoming plans. At the center of all this was Mike Fleck and Samuel Ruchlewicz of Fleck Consulting. I had only met them in passing at this point, but it quickly became apparent that they were running the show.</p> <p>Several weeks later I was asked to submit my resume for consideration in the new administration, so I could continue to serve Spencer as a policy adviser. I happily accepted the offer to serve that followed, imagining all the good I could do working within the Mayor\u2019s Office. I had spent years in and out of governmental offices, both as an activist and consultant, so I believed I had a good idea of what to expect.</p> <p>In reality, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#part-3","title":"PART 3: Working for\u00a0Reading","text":"<p>I began working in my position as Special Assistant for Policy and Sustainability in the Office of the Mayor on January 3, 2012.

I did this by working with each of the departments in support their efforts towards meeting the administration\u2019s goals. Joining me were Lawrence Murin, Special Assistant for Services and Workforce Development; Michael Dee, Special Assistant for Media and Communications; and Marisol Torres, Executive Assistant to the Mayor.</p> <p>My overarching goal was to put Reading on the map in as many positive ways as possible. Preventing bankruptcy and emerging out of Act 47 were the primary objectives, but reversing our economic decline and poverty levels, and making the city more sustainable overall for the 21st century were urgent as well. Not only did I want Reading to improve, I dreamed of it becoming a model community others could learn from.

Because the recovery plan was already in place, any changes had to balance out to be approved, and negotiations with city council began before the new administration took office. Whatever state we assumed the negotiations were in, they fell apart at the first formal budget meeting and started the first of many disasters for the administration.</p> <p>I do not have the space to recount the entire event, especially since that is not the key topic of my essay, so I\u2019ll instead link to some of the Reading Eagle articles that covered it. In a nutshell, the administration and city council clashed over the new positions in the Office of the Mayor, which triggered a number of legal challenges and court battles that cost the City over a million dollars over several years. Experiencing that made me wonder if I could get anything done here.</p> <p>Had this happened to me somewhere else\u200a\u2014\u200awatching the organization I was just hired by fight for nearly two and a half months about my very position\u200a\u2014\u200aI probably would have immediately looked for another job. But it being my hometown, I persisted, and on March 12, 2012, council finally approved an ordinance establishing my position.</p> <p>So what changed to break the logjam? We can look at the way the ordinance was passed for clues. Bill 18\u20132012, which I\u2019ve uploaded here, contains the details of the changes that were agreed upon to create my position.</p> An edited excerpt from Bill 18\u20132012, authorizing the establishment of the positions in the Office of the Mayor in conjunction with pay raises to staff in the Office of City Council. Document from the author\u2019s personal\u00a0archive. <p>In the bill, you\u2019ll see three transactions. The first involved annual reductions from multiple administrative departments to free up funding for the Mayor\u2019s Office positions. The second transaction creates the added expenditures for the Mayor\u2019s Office positions. Given the backlash from members of council, as well as the newspaper, it appears that a fair compromise occurred. However, there is a third transaction that adds additional raises to Council Office staff. This was never discussed publicly, and essentially inserted as a last minute compromise without justification to seal the deal.</p> <p>From my very first few months on the job, I was thrown into an environment of highly transactional political negotiations. Nearly every piece of political negotiations\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially legislation\u200a\u2014\u200agoes through this \u201chorse trading,\u201d \u201cwheeling and dealing,\u201d or \u201cwhat have you done for me lately\u201d process. These terms have a sort of innocuous meaning to them, and you can call them what you want, but I\u2019ve developed what I believe is a more accurate name for this process: a toxic culture of quid pro quo.</p> <p>I believe things have a natural tendency to only get done in our governmental institutions through the reconciliation of a political ledger and at a high cost of time and money. And that\u2019s true even when no one involved has a particularly malicious motivation. Thus, if even a minor corruptive influence is inserted into the process, the entire system can become overridden.</p> <p>From that point forward, I had to look at things from this transactional perspective in order to move the ball forward. Playing the game of competing interests often led to a level of brinkmanship where winning was what mattered most. I do enjoy a good challenge mixed up with some worthy rivalry every now and then, but the sustained intensity of it at city hall was not what I wanted with the survival of the city at stake. I felt like we were our own worst enemy.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#sowing-the-seeds-of-destruction","title":"Sowing the Seeds of Destruction","text":"<p>Contributing heavily to the conflict was the presence of Fleck Consulting in city hall, having secured a contract with the City as paid municipal consultants. In the early weeks of the administration, they showed up almost daily; giving orders, holding meetings, and setting the schedule. Their demanding, demeaning, and disruptive style quickly poisoned the waters within city hall, so when I saw the opportunity to at least create some distance, I did. At the end of 2012 their contract was up for renewal, so I declined it, asserting that the campaign was over and the office staff must be in control of the administration\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>The conflict over influence then became the conflict over influence peddling. In 2013, even after their contract was over, I continued to get complaints that Fleck Consulting were constantly contacting city employees with requests for information or meetings with potential vendors. So I established a policy barring any campaign personnel from directly contacting municipal employees without prior authorization from the Mayor\u2019s office.</p> <p>This activity was happening at the very beginning of the transition, as I mentioned above, where one of the most vocal complaints I heard was regarding Fleck trying to insert so many individuals and organizations with ties to Allentown and Lehigh Valley in Reading politics.

They both grew into vibrant industrial cities in early America that began declining by the mid-20th century. Both are located in the same Northeastern region of Pennsylvania, with similar size, demographics, and all other characteristics. Both entered the 21st century as part of the rustbelt of aging and distressed cities across the state. Within the last decade, however, as Reading continued into the direction of decline, Allentown began to rise, and many other cities were watching Allentown closely to replicate its success.</p> <p>In 2012, the same year the Spencer Administration took office in Reading, Allentown was preparing to hit an inflection point. Up until then, the outlook in Allentown wasn\u2019t much better than Reading, as summarized by Christopher Woods in Allentown\u2019s Neighborhood Improvement Zone: Five Years of Failed Community and Economic Development:</p> <p>Allentown, Pennsylvania, like many other mid-Atlantic industrial cities, was hit hard by the Great Recession. By 2012, a full four years after the generally recognized start of the recession, persons living below the poverty line, as a percentage of total population, soared 4.2 percentage points from pre-recession levels, unemployment was up 6.3 percentage points, and housing vacancy had increased by nearly 1,500 units (U.S. Census Bureau 2008\u20132012). For comparison, the national poverty rate increased only 2.7 percentage points, and the Pennsylvania poverty rate increased 1.6 percentage points over that same time (U.S. Census Bureau 2008\u20132012). Likewise, unemployment increased by 3.0 percentage points nationally and by 3.2 points in Pennsylvania (U.S. Census Bureau 2008\u20132012). In short, Allentown was particularly devastated in the aftermath of the Great Recession.</p> <p>This inflection would begin in the coming year due to a change in Allentown\u2019s tax policy initiated by the passage of PA Act 50 of 2009, sponsored by State Senator Pat Browne. This legislation created the Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ), a unique tax zone similar to a tax incentive program called tax-increment financing (TIF). Woods describes the NIZ as</p> <p>a one-of-a-kind tax subsidy that allows developers to capture state and local tax dollars to pay off the debts accrued in bonding to develop their commercial buildings within the 127 designated acres located in center-city Allentown and along the western side of the Lehigh River (ANIZDA 2017). These tax diversions pay down both interest and principal on the original loans. This subsidy allows developers to offer new commercial spaces at below-market prices (per square ft) because the costs of construction, and the costs of financing the buildings, are partially offset by tax diversions that will be generated once businesses begin to operate within the zone. The NIZ enables lower rents that incentivize large, established businesses to relocate into the zone. Sometimes, existing building owners deride the incentive because they struggle to compete with the artificially low rents (Harris 2019).</p> <p>Although the NIZ legislation happened in 2009, the Great Recession suppressed redevelopment efforts everywhere, so visible activity in Allentown didn\u2019t occur until 2012. When cities across Pennsylvania realized what was going on, and envy turned to anger when they realized the NIZ was exclusive to Allentown, state lawmakers drew up legislation for a statewide program modeled after the NIZ, named the City Revitalization and Improvement Zone (CRIZ). The cities of Reading, Lancaster, York, and more began the race to be awarded a CRIZ designation and attract the redevelopment being touted in Allentown.</p> <p>This video showcases the kind of redevelopment in Allentown being sought out by Reading and many other cities across Pennsylvania through the use of CRIZ authorities. Video courtesy of Center City Allentown.</p> <p>After mapping everything out to write this essay, I realized how important the role of the NIZ ended up being to the theme of corruption. I could write an essay of equal length to this one on my opinions of how NIZ-style economic development and the tax policy that fuels it is problematic in many ways, but these environments are acutely vulnerable to the corruption that redevelopment can attract. I don\u2019t have enough information to show a clear line between Allentown\u2019s redevelopment and the corruption that ensued in the following years, but it\u2019s an important factor to consider.</p> Mayor Pawlowski (third from left) and Mayor Spencer (fifth from left) at a Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness Roundtable in Philadelphia, PA, 2014. Photo courtesy of U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development. <p>One of the most interesting parallels between Reading and Allentown, to me at least, is that both cities share the exact same form of government: the Strong Mayor Home Rule model. In fact, they even share the same home rule charter: Reading established it in 1993, and Allentown adopted essentially the same one in 1996. I have always been a strong proponent of home rule, and still am to this day.</p> <p>The important point in that, however, is the significance of the mayor\u2019s role in both cities specifically chosen form of home rule government. During the legal conflicts early in my time at city hall, I developed a deep knowledge not just of Reading\u2019s charter but of the theory of strong mayor system governing models. The mayor in this system, as a city\u2019s chief executive, holds significant power. The theory argues that having an powerful individual at the head of municipal government can allow the city to better advocate and even fight for its interests unified behind an enabled leader.</p> <p>The mayor of Allentown at the time of the NIZ-led redevelopment was Ed Pawlowski, in his second term as arguably the most popular mayor in the history of the city. Serving as head of a regional community development corporation and then Director of Community and Economic Development in Allentown before running for mayor in 2005, Pawlowski was instrumental in the city\u2019s revitalization efforts. He was seen to many as a good model of a strong mayor.</p> <p>In 2013, Mayor Pawlowski became president of the Pennsylvania Municipal League (PML), and won his third term as Mayor of Allentown. Buoyed by his achievements in Allentown and his involvement in the PML and other statewide and national initiatives, he announced a campaign to run for U.S. Senate in 2015, several months before the FBI raid on Allentown city hall.</p> <p>A week after the raid, Pawlowski suspended his Senate campaign, but went on to win re-election on his fourth term as mayor in 2017 while under investigation. Swearing in as mayor again in January, 2018, he then resigned from office that March after being convicted of 47 counts of corruption charges, and ultimately was sentenced that October to 15 years in prison.</p> <p>In Mayor Pawlowski\u2019s case, the success of the NIZ, and the corruptive influences that followed, are linked to his downfall from the greed-fueled actions that grew within his campaign team. In this WFMZ article covering court testimony during Pawlowski\u2019s trial, you can sense the cognitive dissonance that seemed to exist in the mayor\u2019s mind between his thoughts and his actions while talking to Mike Fleck during a wiretapped recording.</p> <p>Since taking office, Mayor Spencer would often look to see how Mayor Pawlowski was handling things, either for inspiration or even emulation. Leading cities with many of the same issues, from gun violence to homelessness, they were both involved in many of the same initiatives. To Mayor Spencer, Mayor Pawlowski had a winning playbook that he also intended to follow. A big problem, of course, were the political consultants they both hired to grow their success, and their own failures to stop what had started. And in both cases, they reaped what they sowed.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#somethings-rotten-in-reading","title":"Something\u2019s Rotten in\u00a0Reading","text":"<p>Getting back to Reading, while the legal battles with the Charter Board continued, yet another legal issue surfaced in the November of 2013.

This was a key reason I chose to serve under him in the first place. However, good people do not by default make good leaders, and this was unfortunately the case with Mayor Spencer.</p> <p>In many municipalities, the mayor is mainly a figurehead, serving a ceremonial role at public meetings and events, and whose main power is vetoing legislation. Reading, however, adopted a strong mayor form of government, which puts significant demands on the mayor as a chief executive.</p> <p>Although Mayor Spencer believed in, and even fought for, the Strong Mayor doctrine, he was unable to perform that role. I believe this weakness was a key cause of many failures of the Spencer administration, including allowing corruption to occupy the mayor\u2019s office.</p> <p>Every group of people, particularly when they begin working together for a prolonged period of time, go through a set of stages as they feel out their roles, display their personalities, and attempt to get things done. Commonly know as \u201cforming, storming, norming, and performing,\u201d these are Tuckman\u2019s stages of group development. Reading city hall has a long-standing reputation of friction and conflict, so rising tensions within the Spencer administration\u2019s leadership team was inevitable.</p> <p>With the mayor\u2019s office getting off to a rough start, and the disruptive presence of the political consultants, there wasn\u2019t time spent on truly building trust within the leadership team, which included the staff of the mayor\u2019s office, managing director\u2019s office, and the heads of all the departments and divisions of the administration. Things like this naturally take time, so I did my best to facilitate cohesion within the group.</p> <p>By the Spring of 2014, however, things had not yet improved to the \u201cnorming\u201d phase, and I realized that in many cases, Mayor Spencer was a common denominator in disputes. This was especially true in the dynamics between the offices of the mayor and managing director, where miscommunication, mistrust, and often conflicting views on what Mayor Spencer wanted done created clashes.</p> <p>I organized multiple mediation sessions to work through the conflict, but when it became apparent that Mayor Spencer had to step up and give better direction, he wasn\u2019t able to. He was a people-pleaser that preferred to avoid conflict, when possible, and would use ambiguity if it would smooth things over or buy him time.</p> <p>While this weakness was a problem for team dynamics within the administration, nowhere did this weakness have greater consequences than in Mayor Spencer\u2019s decision to continue to retain Fleck Consulting. In what should have been a warning sign, his failure to properly confront this critical issue caused Mayor Spencer to lose several of his closest allies: Lawrence Murin, special assistant in the mayor\u2019s office, and Greg Walker, treasurer of Friends of Vaughn Spencer.</p> <p>Around the same time as the mediation work, Lawrence and I were trying to find replacement consultants for Spencer\u2019s re-election campaign. We met with key local activists and tried to set up calls with their referred contacts, but Mayor Spencer kept declining. The combined failure of Mayor Spencer\u2019s inability to lead through the staff conflicts and refusal to fire Fleck Consulting caused Lawrence to resign in protest. Lawrence encouraged me to resign with him, but I decided to stay on and find a way to solve these problems\u200a\u2014\u200awell-entrenched in my fixer role by this point. I still regret my decision not to resign with Lawrence to this day.</p> <p>In the Summer of 2014, it was reported that the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office was continuing the 2012\u201313 investigation into possible campaign contribution violations by the 2011 Spencer campaign. This revelation, as well as the fact that Fleck Consulting would remain under contract for the re-election, caused Greg Walker, Spencer\u2019s campaign treasurer and a close childhood friend, to resign in protest as well. When no one else would volunteer as treasurer, I offered to do it in classic fixer fashion\u200a\u2014\u200athinking I could somehow use the purse strings to reign Fleck Consulting in. This too, of course, is another decision I still regret to this day.</p> <p>That Fall Mayor Spencer and I met with Fleck Consulting to formalize re-election plans. By that point I was resigned to the fact that Mayor Spencer wouldn\u2019t remove them, and hoped I could somehow control things. They explained that Fleck Consulting merged with Seven Points Consulting to handle campaign consulting and lobbying work was split off into Hamilton Development Partners, allegedly to prevent conflicts of interest. In addition, the PA Attorney General\u2019s office apparently dropped their investigation of the 2011 campaign contributions from IBEW-98, without explanation.</p> <p>These developments gave me a false sense of assurance that everything would be above board, and that perhaps I was overreacting.

Mayor-Elect Spencer continued crediting them for winning the race, giving them the kingmaker status and privilege that comes along with it they were after.</p> <p>Between the fateful meeting in 2011 through the end of 2014, there was a clear pattern of problematic interactions involving the political consultants, and despite the efforts of myself, Lawrence Murin, Greg Walker, and many others, Mayor Spencer insisted they stay. There is a quote of unknown origin that says \u201cwhat you allow is what will continue,\u201d and that is exactly what happened from that point forward.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t just Spencer\u2019s decisions that contributed to our collective downfall; I bear responsibility as well. After six years of reflection and replaying the events of 2015, I can now confidently and publicly speak of the three fatal mistakes I made. All three were tied to campaign money and the culture of corruption that was allowed to continue, and continue it did.</p> <p>On January 15th, 2015, the campaign for Spencer\u2019s re-election officially kicked off, again with Mike Fleck in control of the show. Mayor Spencer was making fundraising calls nearly every day, and the consultants were spending money as fast as the campaign received it. When the mayor could avoid it, he would duck out of meeting with donors and have me meet them instead. Somehow I thought that was better, as I often dealt with matters Mayor Spencer chose to avoid. This was my first fatal mistake.</p> <p>Two months later, that March, we had realized a campaign contribution amendment to the City\u2019s Ethics Code was in effect that election, and four mayoral candidates, including Mayor Spencer, violated the new limits. The Reading Eagle was absolutely right that it was the responsibility of each campaign to know and abide by all rules, but there were substantive issues with the ordinance and its implementation as well. I raised the issue, and worked to repeal it for what I believed were valid reasons, but the quid pro quo methods that resulted were absolutely wrong. This was my second fatal mistake.</p> <p>Several weeks later, now knowing the campaign limits were in place and campaign spending continuing at an alarming rate, I raised my concerns as treasurer to Mayor Spencer. The mayor then called Mike Fleck, and I confronted him about the spending. He exploded over the phone, reminding me that I kicked him out of the mayor\u2019s office, and that we run city hall and he runs that campaign, or he\u2019s walking. \u201cIt\u2019s either Eron or me, Vaughn,\u201d he threatened the mayor, who tried to smooth everything over before I responded. Ending the call, Mayor Spencer just looked at me, shook his head, and said \u201cthey know how to win.\u201d It was at that very moment that I went completely numb.</p> <p>I should have resigned on the spot, but instead I just shut down. All fight in me was gone. I began telling myself that the campaign was almost over, and to just keep my head down and stay out of the way. I believed that after the primary I could get rid of these campaign consultants for good, and everything would be better in the second term. But I was just a fool, and by staying on I buried myself in the hole I\u2019d been digging this entire time. That was my third fatal mistake.</p> <p>On election night, as the the poll returns were nearing completion, I realized we had lost by a landslide. I believed it would be close, but it wasn\u2019t even. Mayor-Elect Wally Scott won by a 3:1 margin over Mayor Spencer. I was stunned at the result, trying to figure out what went wrong. But then I realized it really didn\u2019t matter at that point; we lost, it was over, and thinking of all my struggles, maybe that was best.</p> <p>In the weeks after the election and before the FBI raid, I believed I still wanted a future in government. I thought I could recover my personal work and find a way to move on. If things had been different, that\u2019s probably what would have happened. But I\u2019m actually glad it didn\u2019t, because I was still contaminated by corruption and could have sunk much deeper into that culture in another place.</p> <p>The rest, at that point, is literally history, but certainly not the history I wanted to make. In always trying to \u201cwin\u201d everything we faced, lines were blurred in the beginning, and thickened into a fog of war in the end. Yet we still lost, and at a tremendous cost to ourselves and very community we originally were fighting for. But it wasn\u2019t just the election that we lost. Along the way, in the pursuit of winning, we lost our moral compass, and our ethical guardrails, due to the allowance of a corruptive influence in our work.</p> <p>Mayor Spencer was fond of the following passage in a speech by President Theodore Roosevelt, entitled Citizen in the Republic, which he would cite regularly:</p> <p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</p> <p>And at end of Mayor Spencer\u2019s time in the arena, he failed while daring greatly, but not for the right risks. He was convicted by a jury on August 30, 2018, and on April 24, 2019, he was sentenced to eight years in prison. In the Morning Call article for that day, by Peter Hall, we learn about some of the interactions during his sentencing:</p> <p>\u201cVaughn Spencer had great potential,\u201d [First Asst. U.S. Attorney Jennifer Arbittier-Williams] said. \u201cHe was a public school teacher who was elected mayor and he had the ability to do such good, but he squandered that because of greed and ambition, and now he\u2019s going away to prison for eight years.\u201d</p> <p>Hall reports that Mayor Spencer expressed remorse but couldn\u2019t justify why he allowed the corruption to continue:</p> <p>The judge also questioned Spencer about his decision to keep working with Fleck and Ruchlewicz even after his assistant, Lloyd, \u201crang the bell for you loud and clear\u201d to stay away from pay-to-play\u00a0\u2026 [to which] Spencer on Wednesday told the judge he kept Fleck on his team because he felt it was improper to run a campaign himself while he was responsible for running the city.</p> <p>What was improper, obviously, was the inverse\u200a\u2014\u200abut Mayor Spencer never could see the truth. Towards the end of his questioning, Hall recounts, he apologized for what he put me and other staff through, which I appreciate:</p> <p>Spencer said it stung to hear his employees at trial say they feared he would fire them, noting that he tried to instill a spirit of camaraderie at City Hall, with Reading Phillies outings and Christmas parties paid for from his own pocket.\u00a0\u2026 He singled out his special assistant Eron Lloyd, who pleaded guilty in a bribery scheme to repeal local campaign contributions and was sentenced to probation, as a bright young man whom Spencer never intended to pressure.</p> <p>I forgave Vaughn Spencer for what he put me through, and hold no grudge against him. It is easy to fall into that gladiator mindset, to be completely focused on victory, and simply fight your way through everything in your path. This was the trap the mayor fell into.</p> <p>In the arena, however, you must always remember that what you fight for and how you win matters, too. If you forget this, or even reject this, you allow corruption in the arena, and inevitably, defeat. For if allowed to continue, corruption will always win in the end.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#the-insight-from-my-hindsight","title":"The Insight from My Hindsight","text":"Karma, by Do Ho Suh. Photo courtesy of Juxtapoz Magazine. <p>As I close out this chapter of my life, having reflected on what happened, there is a common pattern throughout the story of failing to heed the many warning signs of what was happening, and then do something about it. I developed a blind spot that slowly spread until I became nearly blind. I\u2019ve talked above about the many times I stayed silent, looked away, played along, or shut down entirely. In doing so, I slowly closed my eyes to corruption. And then I failed.</p> <p>My failure was a very costly and public one that I\u2019ll have to carry with me for the rest of my life, continually revisiting it as necessary before people with the power to pass judgement on me in the context of my criminal record. I can live with that, having full confidence in my true character and resilient nature.</p> <p>But what I can\u2019t live with is the thought that this problem will continue to persist. When political, business, or religious leaders are prosecuted for corruption, language such as \u201ccorruption has been rooted out of our city\u201d is often used, as if removing individuals is enough to stop the spread. We attribute corruption to those indicted, and then carry on believing the problem had been carved out. Until it happens again, in a different time, and with different people, but often the same ways and always for the same reasons: money and power.</p> <p>Corruption will continue until we see the problem for what it is, and solve it in ways to stop it for good. I want my personal story to help others keep their eyes wide open, and hopefully do something about it. That begins with awareness, and there are two actions I urge both individuals and organizations to commit to:</p> <ol> <li>For organizations of all shapes and sizes, public and private, provide and require training of an officially adopted code of ethics, and specifically call out behaviors associated with bribery and corruption as zero tolerance offenses. Transparency International provides anti-corruption toolkits for all segments of society to build their program on.</li> <li>For individuals, ensure you are trained and fully aware of your organization\u2019s code of ethics, including how to safely report violations. As soon as you sense something is wrong, stand up, speak out, push back, and if you aren\u2019t being heard, walk out. Nothing you think you\u2019re doing in an organization is worth the risk of compromising your values and ethics or breaking the law. In the end, you\u2019ll only allow your values and ethics to be compromised.</li> </ol> <p>As for me, although that chapter is now over, my story is not. I entered politics as a reformer, and I have returned to my roots as a reformer of politics, beginning with corruption. I will continue to write about my efforts moving forward, for those interested. And if you have read this far, I thank you immensely for your interest in my experience, and hope you\u2019ll join me in the fight for our collective future.</p> <p>I originally planned to end my essay here, but after the extensive research I did exploring the roots of corruption and what can be done about it, I decided to add a forth part to further contribute to the cause. If you, too, agree that corruption must not continue, and are ready to get involved, I urge you to read ahead.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#part-4","title":"PART 4: True Change Must Begin with the\u00a0System","text":"<p>\u201cIf we put corrupt men in public office and sneeringly acquiesce in their corruptions, then we are wrong ourselves.\u201d  \u2014 Theodore Roosevelt</p> <p>Six years ago, as I was getting my life back on track, I committed to also start educating myself on the problem of corruption like I would any other policy challenge I\u2019ve focused on in the past. Like most people, I previously held a generally one-dimensional view of corruption, colored by images of organized crime, crooked politicians or police officers, and unchecked corporate greed. And in most instances, as I discussed above, the focus was on corrupted individuals or groups of people.</p> <p>After being charged and pleading guilty to bribery myself, of course one of the first thoughts going through my head was \u201cdoes this make me a bad person?\u201d Following my plea hearing, I was admittedly angry for a short time: angry at myself, angry at Vaughn Spencer, angry at the consultants, Reading, the system, everything. I guess it only seems natural at this point to react that way when you screw up your life.</p> <p>Then the denial set in. One of the first things I came across was an article reviewing a provocatively titled book, Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent. I still haven\u2019t read the book, but the author makes some interesting arguments about issues around the prosecution of actions where either intent is questionable or the action may not actually be illegal.</p> <p>I also stumbled across a Twitter account listing ridiculous federal laws that anyone could accidentally break, risking criminal charges. Apparently since then the Twitter account author released a full book of this content, which I probably will read. Finding these resources briefly made me feel better; someone could face the same problems I did by violating the ubiquitous FBI warnings before every movie, in fact!</p> <p>But I quickly sobered up and accepted my reality. To be clear, I violated a portion of 18 USC Section 371. Regardless of my intent, it was wrong, and the law was well-defined in my case. My question of \u201cwas I a bad person because I did a bad thing?\u201d lingered for years to come, despite my research. Fortunately I came across the right books just as I worked up the courage to crack open my personal archives and write this essay, and it\u2019s been illuminating.</p> <p>I know I\u2019m a good person. At night I sleep well, free of the shame I carried with me for years, and when I look in the mirror I see the same person I\u2019ve always been, but a bit wiser, and a bit stronger. My actions and reputation both before and after my ethical lapse during my time in the Spencer administration demonstrate this. My therapist validates this, as well as everyone that knows me.</p> <p>But it still troubled me to think about how everything happened, and how the same thing could happen to anyone else in similar circumstances. I had to remove my personal feelings from the issue and approach it as I would any other complex problem\u200a\u2014\u200awith systems thinking. It has to be a bad system, I believed, but I needed to prove this to myself to truly be at peace. And as it turns out, I was correct. Here\u2019s what I found.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#does-power-corrupt","title":"Does Power\u00a0Corrupt?","text":"<p>Every time someone in a leadership role is charged with corruption, you\u2019ll inevitably hear someone else cynically shake their head and mutter \u201cWell, power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d In my short but intense career in politics, I\u2019ve heard people with power direct that to other people in power, in the same manner politicians often accuse each other of \u201cplaying politics.\u201d</p> <p>To me it felt more like a hollow clich\u00e9, targeted at specific powerful people and not a broad critique, yet beneath the cynical superficiality lies a more profound statement with a real history. In Dr. Brian Klaas\u2019 book Corruptible: Who Gets Power and How it Changes Us, I learned that the quote originated in a letter from John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton (Lord Acton) to Archbishop Mandell Creighton in 1887:</p> <p>I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favorable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way against holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility [that is, the later judgment of historians] has to make up for the want of legal responsibility [that is, legal consequences during the rulers\u2019 lifetimes]. Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority: still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it.</p> <p>The statement, as is often the case, is so much more substantive in its original context. Through stories like that of Lord Acton\u2019s above, Dr. Brian Klaas, a professor of global politics at University College London, sought out to answer four questions related to this quote:</p> <ol> <li>Do worse people get power?</li> <li>Why do we let people control us who clearly have no business being in control?</li> <li>Does power make people worse?</li> <li>How can we ensure that incorruptible people get into power and wield it justly?</li> </ol> <p>I highly recommend you read the full book, but for the purpose of this section, I\u2019ll quickly summarize some of the findings in the book that help to answer these questions.</p> <p>Dr. Klaas addresses the first question (Do worse people get power?) by breaking people into hypothetical \u201cincorruptible\u201d (good) and \u201ccorruptible\u201d (bad) groups to examine the distribution of power. In an ideal world, most would agree, only incorruptible people would seek, get, and hold onto power.</p> <p>But unfortunately, Dr. Klaas explains \u201cpower tends to draw in people who want to control others for the sake of it,\u201d often attracting a disproportionate number of corruptibles and discouraging incorruptibles. Genetics, personality, environment, and individual propensity all contribute, but to what proportion is still unclear. It is clear, however, that we can do a better job of recruitment and screening, across everything from political parties nominating candidates to police academies enrolling trainees.</p> <p>If corruptibles tend to seek out power, we look to the book\u2019s second question: \u201cwhy do we let people control us who clearly have no business being in control?.\u201d Fed by a combination of evolutionary psychology, tribalism, and modern influences of sexism/racism ingrained in our culture, Dr. Klass points out that many of us \u201cstill rely on these arcane, bigoted sorting mechanisms as a cognitive shortcut, even though it\u2019s completely irrational.\u201d</p> <p>Dr. Klass proposes solutions to this include monitoring diversity and inclusion indicators, utilizing \u201cblind recruitment and promotion\u201d processes whenever possible, improving the diversity of the actual hiring and promotion panels, and implementing all these processes earlier in life to strip away these biases from our youth. Overall, greater transparency and accountability will attract and retain the right people for positions of power and repel or remove the wrong ones.</p> <p>Corruptibles, Dr. Klaas explians, are naturally \u201cgood at rising through the ranks through manipulation and intimidation,\u201d and can be found in leadership positions at any of the organizations you are a part of. Understanding how to recognize these traits and carefully deal with people that exhibit them is an important skill, one I urge you to master especially if you\u2019re pursuing a career in politics.</p> <p>But repelling or removing corruptible people is not an easy task. Part V of the book, \u201cPetty Tyrants and Psychopaths,\u201d points out the reasons it\u2019s hard to detect and deal with corruptibles at each stage of seeking, getting, and holding on to power. Our tendencies for selection bias are often in favor of or exploited by people with significant traits attributed to the \u201cdark triad\u201d personalities: Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psycopathy. Understanding these characteristics is essential to navigating toxic organizational cultures.</p> <p>So it appears true that corruptible people are drawn to power, and we have a tendency to give it to them. So does power make people worse? What about good people that seek power for the right reasons? Dr. Klaas explains that</p> <p>\u201cWe often view power through a warped eyes, mistaking inescapable features of power with corruption caused by it. Power does corrupt, as we\u2019ll see in the following chapter. But our overly cynical view of how much power corrupts is wrong. Some of that has to do with four phenomena that are too often overlooked when we praise or condemn authority figures. I call those four phenomena dirty hands; learning to be good at being bad; opportunity knocks; and under the microscope. Each gives us a skewed perspective that causes us to believe that power corrupts people more than it actually does. This isn\u2019t to say that people in power behave virtuously, but rather to show that the widely held view that power makes people worse is often overblown due to cognitive mistakes we make when assessing those in charge.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cdirty hands problem,\u201d Dr. Klaas points out, refers to \u201cthe unique set of moral dilemmas that politicians\u200a\u2014\u200aand others in positions of authority\u200a\u2014\u200aroutinely face.\u201d Can great leaders use bribery for good? As an example, Dr. Klaas cites the time in 1865 that President \u201cHonest Abe\u201d Lincoln had to resort to the transactional political negotiations I talked about in Part II of the essay above to help end slavery:</p> <p>To secure passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which would outlaw slavery in the United States, Lincoln effectively bribed holdouts in the House of Representatives. He bought their votes with unrelated legislative sweeteners. \u201cThe greatest measure of the nineteenth century, Congressman Thaddeus Stevens wrote, \u201cwas passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America.\u201d Pure, that is, except for getting his hands dirty for a much greater good.</p> <p>But while some good people are forced to be bad for good, others are just actually bad people that get better at being bad once in power. In these cases, Dr. Klaas points out that \u201cpeople in authority seem worse not because they got corrupted, but because they learned some new tricks.\u201d From career criminals to authoritarian dictators, he explains that success and power just fuel a continuous improvement in their inherent behavior:</p> <p>Learning is an integral part of getting power and holding on to it. That creates a misperception. If you analyzed the data, it would appear as if someone were getting worse over time\u200a\u2014\u200athat power was corrupting them. In fact, their bad intent may have been static while their effectiveness increased. They were always corrupt. They just got better at it.</p> <p>So are good people and bad people always acting accordingly? A third phenomena helpful in evaluating people with power are known as \u201copportunity knocks\u201d contexts. Is someone less moral because they behaved badly a few times while in a position of power and faced with those difficult decisions daily, while someone else is of a higher moral standing despite not being faced with the same authority and difficult decisions to test them every day? According to Dr. Klaas:</p> <p>Our intuition is to determine who the \u201cbad people\u201d are by how often they do bad things. We make those judgements without any reference to how often an individual faced an easy opportunity to behave badly and hurt other people. That\u2019s a particularly relevant insight for people in power, because being put in a position of authority necessarily produces more frequent\u200a\u2014\u200aand consequential\u200a\u2014\u200aopportunities for wrongdoing.</p> <p>A key requirement for measuring the frequency of how good or bad someone in power is performing is also dependent on how visible their activity is, or as the book puts it, how often are they under the microscope. Rich and powerful people, the thinking goes, tend to get caught more because they are more heavily scrutinized.</p> <p>But what about you? Have you ever regularly broken a law, such has speeding? You were always running late for something important, and everyone does it along that road, anyways. But one day, you get pulled over. You feel singled out, unfairly. Are you morally better if you continued to avoid tickets, and less if you didn\u2019t. So is it a crime if you don\u2019t get caught? Morally speaking, Dr. Klaas suggests that \u201cthen perhaps we\u2019re all worse than we appear, but the powerful get caught more because they\u2019re scrutinized more.\u201d</p> <p>These perspectives, along with others in the book, helped me to understand such situations more deeply than I ever had considered before. To answer the overarching question posed by Lord Acton\u2019s statement, Dr. Klaas agrees that power absolutely corrupts:</p> <p>[B]eing a good person\u200a\u2014\u200asomeone who is affable, altruistic, competent, and kind\u200a\u2014\u200ahelps you get power. Those traits make others admire you. They put their trust in you. They speak highly of you to their bosses. All of that allow you to rise through the ranks. But then (and this is the paradox) those same traits that helped you get to the top are swiftly eroded by the corrosive effect of power, such that you\u2019re more likely to abuse your authority once you\u2019re on the top.</p> <p>The research on the effects of power shows that power has a profound on us, regardless of our inherent corruptibility, and too much is bad for everyone. If that\u2019s true, then safeguards on power are essential to keep these risks in check so that good people are the ones put into power, bad people are kept out, and good leaders aren\u2019t corrupted by their power until inevitably turning bad. But where to start? Dr. Klass points us in the right direction:</p> <p>\u201c[I]t\u2019s clear that certain people are better at manipulating the system to get power. But it\u2019s also clear that bad systems encourage abuse, while good systems prevent it. The solution, as we\u2019ll see in future chapters, is to reform systems so they attract fewer corruptible individuals and, then, stop those who become powerful from committing any abuses. It\u2019s easier said than done.\u201d</p> <p>Parts X through XIII of the book lay out the author\u2019s ten recommendations to help address the need of attracting more incorruptibles, increasing accountability, ensuring transparency, and cultivating the leadership models we need. There\u2019s too much to cover here, but I urge you to read the book to get the full picture.</p> <p>Corruptible lays out the corrosive effect that power has on people and the organizations they gain power within, as well as ways to reinforce our systems against it. But reigning in power is only half of the issue. If corruption is defined as the infinite pursuit of money and power, then we must follow the money to finish our quest to the true core of the problem.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#does-money-corrupt","title":"Does Money\u00a0Corrupt?","text":"<p>I think it\u2019s safe to say that more universal than Lord Acton\u2019s \u201cpower corrupts\u201d statement is the belief that \u201cmoney is the root of all evil.\u201d But in both cases, there\u2019s a subtle but important correction to these quotes that must be made.</p> <p>We hear \u201cPower corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\u201d but the correct statement is \u201cPower tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\u201d The oft-omitted word tends is important because it\u2019s a qualifier on the concept of power. Power, in an of itself, can be neutral or even good. Power in the right hands within well-designed systems is an essential component of a functioning society.</p> <p>The statement \u201cMoney is the root of all evil\u201d is a misquote of 1 Timothy 6:10 (KJV): \u201cFor the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\u201d Here the word love is omitted, and is even more of an important qualifier. Money, in and of itself, can be neutral or even good, too. It\u2019s role in circulating the wealth created through our collective efforts is also an essential component of a functioning society.</p> <p>What both statements suggest is that there are thresholds where a line is crossed, and a good thing becomes bad. In the case of money, it\u2019s the love of money that corrupts, and unfortunately our economic and political systems are obsessed with money to destructive levels. The book On Corruption in America (And What Is At Stake) by Sarah Chayes makes this very clear: \u201cWhen it comes to corruption, money is at the heart of the matter\u00a0\u2026 [t]here seems no making sense of corruption today without stopping to consider what money has come to mean to us\u200a\u2014\u200athe hold it has gained on our hearts.\u201d</p> <p>Weaving history, anthropology, religion, economics, and politics with mythology, Chayes tells the story of the origins of money and democracy, in how they fostered each other at the beginning but then slowly merged into the toxic combination that plagued temples, marketplaces, and the halls of power through each phase of civilization.</p> <p>\u201cMoney\u201d has existed with humankind for many thousands of years, usually in the form of physical commodities like shells, livestock, and even meat skewers. The first modern \u201ccoins\u201d didn\u2019t appear until sometime around 600 BC, but quickly ushered in an increasingly efficient means of exchange. Chayes describes how this efficiency became so effective that it led to a level of commoditization never before seen in civilization, driving \u201cvalue\u201d down to the lowest common denominator:</p> <p>By making objects interchangeable, by giving people access to the most prized privileges without having to live up to the standards of excellence and ethics that earn the right to them, money debases those values themselves.</p> <p>Chayes equates this to the myth of the Midas effect. As a reward from Dionysus for saving a satyr, King Midas was granted the power\u200a\u2014\u200awhich was his request\u200a\u2014\u200ato turn everything he touched to gold. Midas\u2019 reveled in this ability on his return to his kingdom, turning tree twigs and clods of clay to solid gold. But so did the bread, meat, and wine on his dinner table, causing him to beg Dionysus to remove this ability. His power quickly became a curse.</p> <p>In many ways, so too did currency corrupt humanity\u2019s sense of value, as well as the ethical foundations of our early egalitarian societies. Money began to move away from just a means of exchange for wealth to a means to accumulate wealth just through its use. Holy temples became centers of commerce, and with the marketplace came banking and currency exchange. Sacred offerings to the church and community became commodified, and financial intermediaries inserted themselves in the transactions in ways that enriched themselves and exploited the commoners.</p> Christ Driving the Money changers from the Temple by Theodoor Rombouts.

In most depictions, the Prince of Peace is seen with a whip, striking at the occupants. Nearly every scene depicted also displays overturned tables with coins spilling across the floor; a direct reference to the money changers that were monetizing the livestock required for ceremonial sacrifice. Jesus accused the temple of becoming a \u201cden of thieves,\u201d and his actions of protest against corruption, historians agree, would lead to his crucifixion.</p> <p>Chayes continues from there, outlining money\u2019s role throughout history as the lever of power across the globe, calling it the Midas disease, and entrenching in the United States during the 1870s. The Gilded Age, as this period is known, references the satire The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today by Mark Twain and Charles Werner.</p> <p>Today we are seeing more and more comparisons to the Gilded Age, and Chayes draws on the many parallels of the past century to map out the future paths we may find ourselves on. By slaying the \u201cHydra\u201d of kleptocratic networks dedicated to the infinite pursuit of money and power, we have a chance to reclaim the future. If we fail, we will continue to see the collapse of trust in our institutions, the rise of extremism at home and abroad, and the destruction of the Earth and civilization as we know it through climate change and conflict driven by the love of money.</p> <p>It\u2019s impossible for me to properly summarize the rest of the book, so I highly recommend you read it. For the purposes of my essay, I want to focus on a key topic in the book: campaign finance law. It\u2019s obviously something that\u2019s weighed heavily on my mind for some time.</p> <p>Since the 1970s, there has been a long series of Supreme Court cases that have raised the question of what defined political contributions and political corruption\u200a\u2014\u200aand how they relate\u200a\u2014\u200ain the United States of America. The three most recent ones were the Citizens United vs. FEC decision in 2010, the McCutcheon vs. FEC decision in 2014, and the McDonnell vs. United States decision of 2016.</p> <p>In all cases, the result was a further narrowing of the definition of political corruption and a broadening of the rights to campaign contributions. The first two involve \u201cmoney is speech\u201d arguments in the forms of limitations on the amount of campaign contributions and the restrictions on the type of campaign contributors. These cases and the history leading up to them is covered in Corruption in America, by Zephyr Teachout, another excellent book I recommend.</p> <p>While Citizens United v. FEC and McCutcheon v. FEC centered around campaign contribution limitations as a way to limit corruption as a result, McDonnell v. U.S. was more directly focused on whether corruption actually resulted from money given to a public official. The heart of the matter was whether Virginian Governor Robert McDonnell took bribes in exchange for official acts from a businessman seeking the governor\u2019s influence on his business interests.</p> <p>According to 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 201 (a) (3):</p> <p>The term \u2018official act\u2019 means any decision or action on any question, manner, cause, suit, proceeding, or controversy, which may at any time be pending, or which may by law be brought before any public official, in such official\u2019s official capacity, or in such official\u2019s place of trust or profit.</p> <p>In their unanimous decision overturning McDonnell\u2019s conviction, Chayes explains that the Supreme Court took the position that</p> <p>though they agree that \u201cusing [one\u2019s] official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an \u2018official act\u2019 would indeed qualify as an official act,\u201d what McDonnell did fails, in their view, to meet this standard.\u00a0\u2026 Thus did the unanimous Supreme Court transform a broad, commonsense definition of bribery into something narrow and technical.</p> <p>Their fear, Chayes asserts, was that \u201cletting the McDonnell conviction stand\u00a0\u2026 would mean criminalizing politics\u200a\u2014\u200aat least politics as currently practiced.\u201d From town halls to the highest offices, such a punitive decision on quid pro quo had the potential to put nearly every politician behind bars. That\u2019s how bad our toxic culture of quid pro quo has become.</p> <p>But rather than confront corruption for what it is, has the highest court in the land continued to whittle down the definition to the point that our modern temples can be run by a \u201cden of thieves?\u201d I believe it\u2019s unfair to expect the courts to solve this more fundamental problem. The very rules of the game must be changed.</p> <p>To do that, it\u2019s up to us, the people. We must restore the term corruption to its full definition. We know power corrupts and money corrupts, as well. This, then, is where we must focus our efforts: reforming our politics to become as free from the corruptive influences of concentrations of power and the outsized role of campaign contributions as possible.</p> <p>But even as I write this in 2022, the legalization of corruption continues. Another case challenging the legitimacy of bribery laws, Federal Election Commission v. Ted Cruz for Senate, will to be taken up by the Supreme Court next week. Time is running out, and our very future is at stake.</p>"},{"location":"blog/how-corruption-ruins-our-world/#its-time-to-take-action","title":"It\u2019s Time to Take\u00a0Action","text":"<p>Many people believe our country is a crossroads.

When I first started in 2016, I entered as a business analyst while working on my Master\u2019s degree in data science. I had many years of experience in the information technology field, and assumed telecommunications would be a straightforward lateral move.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t. I entered into what felt like a new realm. Sure, there were  switches, servers, and many other familiar layers, but it wasn\u2019t a typical enterprise environment. ILEC? CLEC? CLLI codes? Tariffs? Public Utility Commission? Working for a service provider is definitely a different world, and I quickly realized I had a lot to learn and needed to learn it quick.</p> <p>My role quickly expanded into a generalist in a traditional IT capacity, migrating legacy Windows servers to virtualized Linux servers, upgrading mail and DNS services, establishing operational and billing support systems (OSS/BSS), and trying to fit everything into databases. More of a system administrator than network engineer, I started cramming on the networking side to wrap my head around VLANs, subnetting, and routing protocols. Within a year, I was running the IT department.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t directly responsible for managing the network, but as the department head, I needed to understand how everything worked and how to at least support my team in their jobs. I listened to every Packet Pushers podcast I thought I could learn from as I commuted to and from work. To fill the gaps in my knowledge, I grabbed what was most commonly recommended, CompTIA\u2019s Network+ and Cisco\u2019s CCNA certification guides, and though I would have everything covered. I  found Network+ to be broad, which was very helpful, but the training material on it I found sometimes lacked practical detail. CCNA was nearly the opposite, but was also too vendor-specific and I didn\u2019t have Cisco gear to practice on.</p> <p>Next came all the challenges of connecting customers (or \u201csubs,\u201d short for subscribers, as they\u2019re more commonly called in the service provider world). CPEs? Double NAT? Wi-Fi troubleshooting? I finally grasped IPv4 and subnetting, and I realized that we\u2019d be exhausting our public IPv4 address space and need to implement dual-stack address planning. IPv6?! All the documentation I\u2019d studied was primarily in IPv4, including my CompTIA+ and CCNA books! Back into the rabbit hole I went.</p> <p>Around that time we were preparing to roll out a new broadband service, based on gigabit passive optical network (GPON) technology, which wasn\u2019t covered in either of my study materials. OLTs? ONTs? PLC splitters?! Another huge knowledge gap opened up, and I was stuck digging through  literally thousands of pages of vendor material, then searching online to piece together the fundamentals. None of this was in either the Network+ or CCNA material. Fortunately I discovered Light Brigade\u2019s training material for the Fiber Broadband Association\u2019s Certified Fiber to the Home Professional (CFHP) program, and it finally all made sense.</p> <p>I was beginning to feel like everything was accounted for. We had an IPAM/DCIM system for our data center, modern firewalling to protect the network, subscribers were getting service and our billing system was allowing them to pay, and I just wrapped my head around how many IPv6 addresses we had in our first /32 allocation from ARIN.</p> <p>All of this was non-trivial; there were challenges at every level, and experience was hard-earned through trial and error. Understanding it all, however, made it actually manageable, and I thought to myself, \u201cI think I finally know this, and I can do this.\u201d Countless hours studying, talking with and learning from my team, reading industry news and magazines, and constantly working to improve upon every mistake we encountered gave way to a rewarding feeling of personal achievement.</p> <p>\u201cHmm, I guess I\u2019m beginning to \u2018get\u2019 telecom,\u201d I thought as I stood deep inside the rabbit hole, feeling proud as I peered up at the entrance (or further down the learning curve?). I finally did it. I conceptually and officially carved out my domain in the company, which started out in my mind as the \u201cIT department,\u201d but more accurately became what\u2019s called the \u201cCentral Office,\u201d or \u201cCO\u201d for short. But there was other side of equation of telecom operations that I still did not understand: the  \u201cOutside Plant,\u201d or \u201cOSP\u201d for short.</p> <p>For my first year in telecom, OSP was just another department in the company, and my interactions were limited to a few key aspects where my team and their team had to coordinate. This included testing and connecting new customer circuits and troubleshooting when something went wrong. For the most part, both sides quickly tried to determine if it was a CO or OSP problem, and hand it off accordingly.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t long after that, however, that I began to realize that the line between these two departments was not as clear as the \u201cdemarc\u201d delineating responsibility between the customer and service provider. For instance, OSP oversaw the installation technicians that ran the cabling and set up the customer premises equipment (CPE) that brought service to our subscribers. When something went wrong with the CPE, and the fiber connection wasn\u2019t the issue, who\u2019s problem was it?</p> <p>The general rule was that if it plugged in, and wasn\u2019t a power tool or specialized OSP equipment, it became CO\u2019s responsibility. For CPE, this was especially true when it turned out to be a bug in the firmware or provisioning error. When a service call was necessary to correct the issue, coordination was harder to control. \u201cCO doesn\u2019t train and manage the technicians,\u201d I thought, \u201cbut we\u2019re dependent on them as the front-line of our network. Our work is more interrelated than I  realized.\u201d</p> <p>This became further ingrained when we had to rethink our OSP deployment to meet demand for our services. Until then, OSP relied on a combination of legacy documentation, paper and PDF-based CAD drawings, and Google Earth for network planning. Knowing this, as well as how difficult  managing this information would be as we scaled, I stepped in and implemented a geographic information system (GIS) solution for OSP.</p> <p>In order to model the geodatabase that would store all the former KMZ files and newly digitized records, I needed to better understand the terms and concepts of OSP. We needed records for poles, attachments, conduit, cables, hand holes, and many other individual elements. I identified several dozen common types of hardware just for attachments, and struggled to determine the official names for these items. I learned a lot, as usual, digging in vendor materials and websites I found while searching online, but it was still all very abstract, and nothing seemed authoritative. For the most part, I was building data models.</p> <p>Several months later, however, it all became very real for me. In the Fall of 2017, a dispute with a pole owner we had extensive facilities attached to turned into a lawsuit, and subsequent personnel changes left the position overseeing OSP vacant. I was asked by my boss to temporarily take over OSP operations and assist with lawsuit preparations, and my time on OSP went into overdrive. Joint use agreements, the National Electrical Safety Code (NESC), and telecommunications regulatory law consumed most my time, but I still had to deal with daily work of construction, installation, and outage restorations.</p> <p>I was fortunate to have already developed the company\u2019s GIS, which became instrumental in auditing and documenting the network. I spent weeks in the field with my team examining alleged safety and authorization issues, to the point I couldn\u2019t stop looking at poles anywhere I went. J-hook? Through bolt? ADSS cable? Mid-span clearance? Worker safety zone? I had to learn them all, and I accumulated many valuable resources along the way, especially from Building Industry Consulting Service International (BICSI) and the Fiber Optics Association (FOA).</p> <p>I got so absorbed in OSP that I wrote my graduate thesis on the topic of Utility Pole Measurements and Feature Analysis Using Computer Vision and Photogrammetry, which blended OSP with data science disciplines. I learned a lot through my research, which only just scratched the surface, and I look forward to picking up where I left off there.</p> <p>After completing my Master\u2019s degree in Data Science in the Summer of 2018, I was able to focus more time and energy into my OSP studies. Our company became a FOA Corporate Member,  which gave us access to resources and material discounts enough to start an in-house training program for our technicians to attain the CFOT designation. These are a great starting point for technicians and network engineers in the fiber industry.</p> <p>After setting that up and becoming comfortable enough with the material, I decided to join BICSI as a member and dedicate my time to studying the OSP Design Reference Manual. After reading that (which took several months!), I felt like I finally grasped OSP, as well, and was on the right track. I followed up with attending the live OSP102: Applied Outside Plant Design course, which was fantastic (thanks Mark and Craig!). Earlier this year, I sat for the BICSI OSP exam, and earned my first official industry certification.</p> <p>Fast forward to today, and looking back on all the conceptual studies and real-world projects I\u2019ve completed, I can proudly say I\u2019m a telecom craftsman, someone skilled in what I do. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m an expert, by any means. Like with my Master\u2019s degree, I now simply know what I don\u2019t really know, and I know what I really need to keep learning.</p> <p>At this point in my journey, my goal is to share as much as I can with new craftspeople, and encourage other seasoned craftspeople share their stories, as well. I view it as learning by teaching, you could say. Telecommunications is a great industry to be in, during a time when our skills and abilities are not only necessary, but essential to fueling the future in a connected World.

You may already have a well-developed learning system that has served you well, or you continue to struggle through each attempt. No matter your level, I believe you will benefit from reading the following books:</p> <ul> <li>A Mind for Numbers, by Barbara Oakley. Don\u2019t let the subtitle, \u201cHow to Excel at Math and Science,\u201d fool you\u2014this book is designed to help you rewire your brain to learn more effectively through the practical application of neuroscience and cognitive psychology. To get the most out of the book, I recommend also taking the free Learning How to Learn course on Coursera, taught by the same author.</li> <li>Ultralearning, by Scott H. Young. Like A Mind for Numbers, this book will introduce you to effective techniques to deepen your ability to learn new skills, this time with a focus on \u201caggressive, self-directed learning\u201d towards competence or mastery in compressed periods of time. The author has a large number of articles and videos on his approach you can check out, such as this one. I try to use this method for every new \u201clearning project\u201d I attempt at this point.</li> <li>Atomic Habits, by James Clear. Developing new learning habits won\u2019t produce the results you\u2019re after if you can\u2019t maintain them, which is why learning better habits to maintain your learning techniques are also important. Everyone, myself included, tend to fall back to ingrained patterns of behavior, and for most of us, our old learning habits are poorly developed.</li> <li>Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool. If you\u2019ve heard of the 10,000 hours of practice rule, this book explains that while it\u2019s not that simple, it is straightforward to work towards mastery. The secret is purposeful practice, carried out daily with dedication and discipline. With this breakthrough mindset, you\u2019ll be able to advance from beginner to expert in a proven, sustainable way.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/upgrade-your-learning-for-ict-career-success/#assemble-your-tools-and-tactics","title":"Assemble Your Tools and Tactics","text":"<p>After developing effective learning techniques, the next step is to equip yourself with good tools, tactics, and other resources to help you in your learning efforts. A Mind for Numbers and Ultralearning cover a wide range of them in a general sense, so I\u2019ll just list my favorites to get you started.</p> <ul> <li>Flashcards. Spaced repetition is an essential technique the books above cover in-depth, and one of the best tools to practice this is Anki, an open source flashcard application. In addition to the many features available in the software, one of highest values it offers is the free cloud accounts that allow you to sync your flashcard decks across devices. I have a daily routine of hitting decks of upcoming exams, as well as reviewing content I\u2019m already certified on as refreshers. There are many tutorials about using Anki available on YouTube, and it\u2019s particularly popular in the medical school community.</li> <li>Mind Mapping. In Ultralearning you\u2019ll learn about the concept of metalearning, which is the process of mapping out your learning plan. Mind maps, popularized by Tony Buzan, are a great way to construct and visualize concepts; I often use them as I explore new topics and build off of that. There are a wealth of mind map apps available today, with XMind being my personal favorite. I\u2019ll be polishing some of my personal ones and sharing them in future content here on Telecom Craft.</li> <li>Get Organized. To further help you organize your learning projects, it\u2019s good to have a system to consolidate all your activities within. Any note-taking app can be helpful as long as you use it consistently, and after using many over the years, I\u2019ve settled on Notion. From lists of learning resources to kanban boards to track my study progress, Notion gives me incredible flexibility in organizing things exactly the way I need them, like a second brain. Find something that works for you and stick with it; don\u2019t try to keep it all in your head!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/upgrade-your-learning-for-ict-career-success/#practice-practice-practice-deliberately","title":"Practice, Practice, Practice\u2026 Deliberately!","text":"<p>With both your tools and techniques together, begin developing your daily habit of practicing your craft. You may not have a lot of time in addition to just studying, but through the activities below, you will begin to supplement your studies and apply your skills in ways that reinforce your learning. Most of them can be done in the daily time spent browsing social media, in fact. Find things you enjoy and do them consistently!</p> <ul> <li>Writing to Learn. Writing is an excellent way to force yourself to explain concepts you\u2019re in the process of learning, particularly for technical content. A Packet Pushers episode from 2020 covers this in-depth, so check it out. This blog is my own personal commitment to furthering my practice, as well as improving my writing overall, and I urge you to try it, too.</li> <li>Talking to Learn. Who doesn\u2019t like to talk shop? Find people you can talk with about the things you\u2019re learning in a safe and supportive space. Tell them what you\u2019re learning about, and share any insights you\u2019ve recently gained or difficult concepts you\u2019re struggling with. There are many online communities for ICT, and a great starting point if you live in North America is the North American Network Operator Group (NANOG); I\u2019ve followed their mailing list for years and a ton of interesting conversations occur there. Here on LinkedIn I\u2019ve found possibly the most vibrant ICT community of any I\u2019m part of, which is why I focus my time on this platform.</li> <li>Watching to Learn. In general, I\u2019ve found YouTube to be very valuable for learning about engineering and construction topics. In addition to its popular mailing list, NANOG, mentioned above, has a wealth of conference presentations available on their channel. Lastly, be sure to follow both vendors and service providers to find videos about products and services and how network operators are actually using them in the field. When you know something well, consider making your own videos about it.</li> <li>Listening to Learn. Like video, podcasts are an excellent source for industry information. As part of my network engineering ultralearning project, I began consuming multiple episodes of the Packet Pushers podcasts every day. It admittedly took me a while to understand the difference between eBGP and iBGP just by listening, for example, but I quickly absorbed a lot of information just in my commute to and from work.</li> <li>Get Hands-on with Home Labs. It\u2019s good to take in information from multiple sources and via multiple forms of media, but at some point you simply need to get your hands on telecom hardware and software and start experimenting. This is admittedly not always easy, as setting up a pole line or conduit trench in your backyard is probably not a good idea, and trying to build a DWDM point to point link is more expensive than you want to even think about at this level. However, there are many things you CAN do, and creating useful telecom home labs is one of the big goals I have for myself.</li> </ul> <p>Hopefully this is a good starting point for your journey into ICT learning.
