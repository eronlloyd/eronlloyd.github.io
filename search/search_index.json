In an era where we tend to scatter our online presence online, I thought it would be useful to take back some of that control and consolidate important content here instead.</p> <p>From personal writing to projects and initiatives I'm involved in, and even my attempts to become an artist, I plan to share all that with you.</p> <p>Professionally, I'm currently an information and communication technology (ICT) designer, primarily focused on large scale telecom and data center projects across the U.S. For the past few years I've enjoyed sharing my experience growing and learning in the industry and sharing those experiences, and I intend to continue that here.</p> <p>Outside of work, I've also be concentrating on several efforts I'm extremely passionate about, particularly campaigning for pro-democracy and anti-corruption legislative reform with organizations like March on Harrisburg, Represent US, and Equal Citizens. I've seen firsthand how corruption can destroy our future, and I'm committed to helping to fight against it. Expect a lot of discussion on this urgent topic.</p> <p>To stay strong, I've rooted my spiritual health in the Dharma, and am a Zen Buddhist practicioner. As part of that practice, I intend to produce and share personal writings and art that drawn from that storehouse of wisdom and promote peace within myself and in a World that could always use more.</p> <p>I'm happy if you find any of this useful and enjoyable. </p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""}]}
